p225_353|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p225_354|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p225_355|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p225_356|I said he was set to retire.
p225_357|It is a sign of hope.
p225_358|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p225_359|But we welcome this document.
p225_363|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
p225_365|You did not see it.
p225_366|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p226_361|Our numbers are small.
p226_362|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p226_363|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p226_364|This is a club on the rise.
p226_365|I have got a wife to feed.
p226_366|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p226_367|Equity declined to comment.
p226_368|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p226_369|He took over our lives.
p226_370|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p227_393|You have to rely on each other.
p227_394|I wanted to go out on a high.
p227_395|I felt the head was very like me.
p227_396|It is a terrible equation.
p227_397|They have not got anyone.
p227_398|I can hardly believe it.
p227_399|How do you take them away ?
p227_400|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p227_401|After the match, do you ?
p227_402|Persuaded to change his mind.
p228_362|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p228_363|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p228_364|It is a simple equation.
p228_365|So there, we won.
p228_366|But I managed.
p228_367|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p228_368|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p228_369|There is no signature.
p228_370|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p228_371|It became a national network.
p229_381|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p229_382|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p229_384|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
p229_386|Three years ago he would have been.
p229_387|That team is due to be announced this morning.
p229_388|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p229_389|That's the name of the game, though.
p229_390|There were no casualties.
p229_391|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p229_392|Yet the data is compelling.
p230_407|The casualties were not named.
p230_408|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p230_409|It had been on the cards.
p230_410|The second goal was superb.
p230_411|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p230_413|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p230_414|It is the old story.
p230_415|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
p230_416|No date has been set for a meeting.
p230_417|We have to build a new team in the minimum of time.
p231_467|Classes must be reduced by half.
p231_468|War is not the action.
p231_469|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p231_470|It is too early to speculate.
p231_471|Dennis was not so sure.
p231_472|He felt it was the right time.
p231_473|It was clear on Thursday.
p231_474|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p231_475|It was all in a short period of time.
p231_476|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p232_406|He was a crazy man.
p232_407|We should have known.
p232_408|Feel the air, the space.
p232_409|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p232_410|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p232_411|You wanted the evidence.
p232_412|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p232_413|It was that bad, that low.
p232_414|I was very young.
p232_415|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p233_383|It is unusual.
p233_384|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p233_385|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p233_386|That set the tone.
p233_387|It was a breathtaking moment.
p233_388|I was in jail for five years.
p233_389|What happened in the summer ?
p233_390|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p233_391|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p233_392|He has not created a Festival resource.
p234_352|And it's a goodbye from him.
p234_353|They have to be addressed.
p234_354|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p234_355|However, a bid was never made.
p234_356|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
p234_357|The City welcomed the numbers.
p234_358|Something is going to have to give.
p234_359|There's still a bit to go.
p234_360|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p234_361|We never played at all.
p236_494|It was still there, but right at the end.
p236_495|The Prime Minister has been in touch.
p236_496|They never gave up hope.
p236_497|He had planned to sell it.
p236_498|I was ready for this.
p236_499|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p236_500|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
p236_501|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p236_502|I stayed away from the defence.
p236_503|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p237_342|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p237_343|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p237_344|The train was on time.
p237_345|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p237_346|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p237_347|Indeed, it was magical.
p237_348|Look at the witnesses.
p237_349|Nobody else was with me.
p237_350|The composer will conduct.
p237_351|It should be scrapped.
p238_450|Either way, it's very funny.
p238_451|It has become a way of life.
p238_452|We didn't want any trouble.
p238_453|It seemed a logical expansion.
p238_454|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p238_455|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
p238_456|Now it has doubled in size.
p238_458|I have worked as a stand-up there often.
p238_459|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p238_460|It is business as usual.
p239_494|The songs are just so good.
p239_495|The whole thing was just unreal.
p239_496|I can hardly believe it.
p239_497|They haven't been thought through.
p239_498|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p239_499|I am not unduly surprised.
p239_500|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p239_501|You are a different people.
p239_502|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
p239_503|The world record is suspicious.
p240_371|That would help.
p240_372|A deadline is still essential.
p240_373|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p240_374|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p240_375|We are looking for perfection.
p240_376|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p240_377|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p240_378|It's been hard.
p240_379|It's now down in black and white.
p240_380|Safety was also an issue.
p241_364|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p241_365|The play is based on a real-life event.
p241_366|He could face a jail sentence.
p241_368|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p241_369|There was no hint of scandal.
p241_370|Safety was also an issue.
p241_371|Well, the big day has arrived.
p241_372|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p241_373|Talks are progressing.
p241_374|There is no signature.
p243_389|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p243_390|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
p243_391|My tax affairs have been totally open.
p243_392|Five years ago its return was rejected.
p243_393|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
p243_394|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
p243_395|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
p243_396|We are keen to see truth and justice.
p243_397|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p243_398|People have a wish to charge twice.
p244_415|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p244_416|There is no need to panic.
p244_417|It had been on the cards.
p244_418|However, he said the proposal was at an early stage.
p244_419|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p244_420|That might mean another delay.
p244_421|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p244_422|I am delighted for them.
p244_423|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p244_424|But it was a struggle.
p245_350|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p245_351|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p245_352|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p245_353|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p245_354|It was very formal.
p245_355|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p245_356|It's not that clear-cut.
p245_357|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p245_358|He's very explosive.
p245_359|But nothing happened.
p246_351|I was in the train station overnight.
p246_352|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p246_353|Hartley should know.
p246_354|That would help.
p246_355|It is a memorial.
p246_357|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p246_358|Their time has gone.
p246_359|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p246_360|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p246_361|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p247_469|Now that business is banned.)
p247_470|They were good years for him.)
p247_471|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.)
p247_472|And it covers the spectrum.)
p247_473|We will now look into its historical background.)
p247_474|They were impressive against France.)
p247_475|The chief constable has retired.)
p247_476|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.)
p247_477|The casting of her husband was an accident.)
p247_479|That was the first time I worked with Richard.)
p248_367|Well, the big day has arrived.
p248_368|Five members were disciplined.
p248_369|There is no signature.
p248_370|I am a wealthy person.
p248_371|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p248_372|Colour was at the core of his life.
p248_373|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p248_374|He's a lovely young man.
p248_375|The casualties were not named.
p248_376|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p249_344|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p249_345|Eight months later, he was dead.
p249_347|It's all going to clear the debt.
p249_348|He had played well in that central role.
p249_349|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p249_350|It is horrible.
p249_351|It was very formal.
p249_352|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p249_353|I kept going for her.
p249_354|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p250_487|The processing plant was closed yesterday.
p250_488|The Israeli military denied the claim.
p250_489|He is not a dancer.
p250_490|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
p250_491|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
p250_492|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
p250_493|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
p250_494|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p250_495|We would welcome a commercial partner or partners.
p250_496|Subsidy income will not be affected.
p251_362|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p251_364|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p251_365|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p251_366|However, it was well worth the wait.
p251_367|He has seen the past.
p251_368|We will be homeless.
p251_369|That would help.
p251_372|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p251_373|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p251_374|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p252_402|So what happens next ?
p252_403|Had this been common practice ?
p252_404|What do they want us to do ?
p252_405|Is it worth it ?
p252_406|Does it matter ?
p252_407|The doctors are quite positive about my progress.
p252_408|They had to have hospital treatment.
p252_409|Five local people were injured.
p252_410|All the dead were believed to have been French.
p252_411|I'd like to report a murder.
p253_400|The weekly average was three hours.
p253_401|Relief was beyond belief.
p253_402|He got his degree.
p253_403|went on sale.
p253_404|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p253_405|Until they came to do it.
p253_407|That may be.
p253_408|It is legally binding.
p253_409|We went straight into the bedroom.
p253_410|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p254_394|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p254_395|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p254_396|We're looking for justice.
p254_397|I can lead by example.
p254_398|Eriksson would have approved.
p254_399|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p254_400|It was a breathtaking moment.
p254_401|It really is a gift to the world.
p254_402|The car was just there.
p254_403|It was on fire.
p255_372|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p255_373|It's a long process.
p255_374|Not because they want to sing about something.
p255_375|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
p255_376|Colour was at the core of his life.
p255_377|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p255_378|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p255_379|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p255_380|The casualties were not named.
p255_381|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
p256_311|This is the culture change in medicine.
p256_312|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p256_313|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
p256_314|It is all credit to them today.
p256_315|They were fantastic.
p256_316|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p256_317|She is very distinctive.
p256_318|It's not even finished.
p256_319|Henman has been warned.
p256_320|It should be equal.
p257_425|It is bizarre.
p257_426|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p257_427|I was just overwhelmed.
p257_428|It had been in place since last July.
p257_429|It's a miracle.
p257_430|The first minister is obviously concerned to hear about this incident.
p257_431|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p257_432|They will form a tribute.
p257_433|The whole region is in shock.
p257_434|The bill would be massive.
p258_405|They are not left wing.
p258_406|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
p258_407|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
p258_408|He scored a touchdown.
p258_409|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p258_410|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p258_411|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p258_412|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p258_413|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p258_414|Also, it is the season of goodwill.
p259_472|Then came the farewell to Europe.)
p259_473|I'm very passionate about my country.)
p259_474|Phil Mickelson did that last year.)
p259_475|There was no trouble at all.)
p259_476|He deserved a red card.)
p259_477|The price paid for it was not disclosed.)
p259_478|You have to have a proven track record to get them.)
p259_479|Some problems were too complex.)
p259_480|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.)
p259_481|The chief constable has retired.)
p260_348|A great deal has been achieved.
p260_349|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p260_350|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p260_351|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p260_352|They should take their mobile phones.
p260_353|Eight months later, he was dead.
p260_354|I HAVE a dream.
p260_355|We have big ideas.
p260_356|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p260_357|I first met him last summer.
p261_465|She would take the Farmer to the opera.
p261_466|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p261_467|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
p261_468|No options are excluded at all.
p261_469|They are defined by law.
p261_470|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p261_471|I'm very pleased for the club and for myself.
p261_472|It's been a long, long journey.
p261_473|War is not the action.
p261_474|My place is in the kitchen.
p262_385|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p262_386|We're looking for justice.
p262_387|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p262_388|They are good.
p262_389|It was a breathtaking moment.
p262_390|It was on fire.
p262_391|This is a major step forward for carers.
p262_392|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p262_393|Emotions were complex.
p262_394|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p263_464|We are over the moon.
p263_465|It was another reminder of the power of an image.
p263_466|They're just a good retailer.
p263_467|Tickets will be at a premium.
p263_468|It's been a long, long journey.
p263_469|I just got under the ball a bit.
p263_470|There is a similar story for milk and dairy products.
p263_471|That should get their attention.
p263_472|It's just a place to open it.
p263_473|My place is in the kitchen.
p264_486|The accident seemed so simple.)
p264_487|Her father wasn't best pleased.)
p264_488|Just look at his fashion sense.)
p264_489|That time may never be broken.)
p264_490|We've got good options.)
p264_491|This operation will change her life.)
p264_492|New York is my home.)
p264_493|He added that trading data for the new stores would be revealed in due course.)
p264_494|That means a ban on French products.)
p264_495|This is yet another example of double standards from headquarters.)
p265_343|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p265_344|He could face a jail sentence.
p265_345|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p265_346|It's been hard.
p265_347|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p265_348|A review is under way.
p265_349|Safety was also an issue.
p265_350|So there, we won.
p265_351|He was the architect.
p265_352|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p266_415|He was really great.
p266_416|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p266_417|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p266_418|That may be.
p266_419|It is legally binding.
p266_420|Paris is not only young.
p266_421|Such as it is.
p266_422|It looked like a war zone.
p266_423|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p266_424|I chose to make a film.
p267_412|My aim is a top six finish.
p267_413|Such an attack is bizarre.
p267_414|These guys are looking for business.
p267_415|He is on the wrong side.
p267_416|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p267_417|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p267_418|Further new equity was raised in a placing in January.
p267_419|It needs to be volatile.
p267_420|I've got my own ideas.
p267_421|Nobody should believe this story.
p268_402|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
p268_403|We're looking for unity in the council.
p268_404|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p268_405|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
p268_406|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p268_407|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p268_408|I should think so, too.
p268_409|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p268_410|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p268_411|The capital costs are modest.
p269_394|I'm pleased about one thing.
p269_395|It is unusual.
p269_396|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p269_397|I suspect the latter.
p269_398|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p269_399|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p269_400|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p269_401|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p269_402|The car was just there.
p269_403|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p270_453|They were good years for him.
p270_454|Let that be their memorial.
p270_455|This is the stuff of live music.
p270_456|We expect a rise by the end of the second quarter.
p270_457|We will deal with the refugees.
p270_458|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p270_459|We are over the moon.
p270_460|They're just a good retailer.
p270_461|We are now up against it.
p270_462|Something happened on that island.
p271_445|They were not even allowed to see them.
p271_446|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p271_447|Bill is a mentor.
p271_448|We are certainly moving in the right direction as a club.
p271_449|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p271_450|Was it worth it?
p271_451|It was ignored.
p271_452|It is bizarre.
p271_453|It had been in place since last July.
p271_454|It's a miracle.
p272_403|Then , he laughs.
p272_404|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p272_405|It is an absolute nonsense.
p272_406|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p272_407|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p272_408|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p272_409|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p272_410|Feel the air, the space.
p272_411|He got his degree.
p272_412|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p273_427|It was a breathtaking moment.
p273_428|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p273_429|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
p273_430|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
p273_431|They are not left wing.
p273_432|It is not a standing army.
p273_433|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
p273_434|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p273_435|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
p273_436|He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.
p274_461|The boys are mentally focused.)
p274_462|Driving has been the key.)
p274_463|It's because they can't understand the language.)
p274_464|Then came the farewell to Europe.)
p274_465|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.)
p274_466|Phil Mickelson did that last year.)
p274_467|The answer was up there on the stage.)
p274_468|It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.)
p274_469|He will not be involved in school discipline.)
p274_470|You have to have a proven track record to get them.)
p275_420|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p275_421|I know the worry over Iraq.
p275_422|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
p275_423|It's been a long, long journey.
p275_424|We are now up against it.
p275_425|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p275_426|I want a career.
p275_427|He deserved a red card.
p275_428|And they replied.
p275_429|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p276_456|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
p276_457|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p276_458|It will take place in July.
p276_459|There's not much money in cycling.
p276_460|We will pay their bills.
p276_461|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p276_462|It was very positive and very helpful.
p276_463|Now we see no mention of rising rates.
p276_464|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p276_465|We are having a look.
p277_454|Scotland has a dismal record of teenage pregnancy rates.
p277_455|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
p277_456|If they don't, they should say so.
p277_457|It is a vicious circle.
p277_458|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p277_459|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p277_460|I'd love to be like Peter.
p277_461|I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
p277_462|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p277_463|The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
p278_401|They know it'll be fantastic.
p278_402|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p278_403|Clark is back on top form.
p278_404|I had a fortunate war.
p278_405|We must improve our relations with government.
p278_406|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p278_407|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p278_408|That is the ultimate revenge.
p278_409|The next few months will tell.
p278_410|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p279_397|Not because they want to sing about something.
p279_398|You make the choice.
p279_399|I have been in good form for the last two years.
p279_400|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
p279_401|Nobody even knew it had happened.
p279_402|What would be the point?
p279_403|The weekly average was three hours.
p279_404|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p279_405|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p279_406|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p280_401|Today he will meet the Italian press but he will give little away.
p280_402|Every blood test on sheep in Scotland has been completely clear.
p280_403|These old songs are very nice to play.
p280_404|My views on the decision are well known.
p280_405|I'd never seen a play about me.
p280_406|We were on top and could have won.
p280_407|Some would say that that culture had been created already.
p280_408|So it looks like a done deal.
p280_409|The play was to go straight ahead.
p280_410|At the core of these issues are real people with real jobs.
p281_451|We have the location, which is assured.
p281_452|They were good years for him.
p281_453|We're all paying for it.
p281_454|This is the stuff of live music.
p281_455|She has now been registered as disabled.
p281_456|We could hardly believe it.
p281_457|The men are very worried.
p281_458|Both promotions come as no surprise.
p281_459|We are going through the process.
p281_460|It must never be seen as second class.
p282_361|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p282_362|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p282_363|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p282_364|It is a simple equation.
p282_365|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p282_366|It was a funny game.
p282_367|There wasn't a goal.
p282_368|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p282_369|Colour was at the core of his life.
p282_370|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p283_462|Let that be their memorial.
p283_463|This morning I got a call from my wife.
p283_464|She has now been registered as disabled.
p283_465|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p283_466|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p283_467|It all began as an accident.
p283_468|We are going through the process.
p283_469|Ms Jackson was not present to put her case.
p283_470|City sentiment is in his favour.
p283_471|It's been a long, long journey.
p284_416|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p284_417|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p284_418|It is legally binding.
p284_419|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p284_420|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p284_421|Eriksson would have approved.
p284_422|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p284_423|It was little else.
p284_424|He is to appeal.
p284_425|Nato will prevail.
p285_394|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p285_395|It will take place in July.
p285_396|What happened in the summer?
p285_397|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p285_398|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p285_399|Is that possible?
p285_400|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p285_401|What was the difference between them?
p285_402|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p285_403|Emotions were complex.
p286_459|The damage has been done.
p286_460|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p286_461|They are defined by law.
p286_462|The peace process will be buried!
p286_463|We are now up against it.
p286_464|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
p286_465|It is vital to clarify their role.
p286_466|He was backed by Downing Street.
p286_467|It also indicated that her condition had deteriorated.
p286_468|You have to have a proven track record to get them.
p287_415|I am astonished at attack.
p287_416|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p287_417|There is a solution, she believes.
p287_418|Potions said he would drive.
p287_419|It was important to win the singles.
p287_420|I'm pleased about one thing.
p287_421|That's been all around Europe with me.
p287_422|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p287_423|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p287_424|Both promotions come as no surprise.
p288_403|What would be the point?
p288_404|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p288_405|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p288_406|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p288_407|The real enemy is in your own back yard.
p288_408|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p288_409|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p288_410|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p288_411|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p288_412|That may be.
p292_415|It is my decision and my decision alone.
p292_416|A venue was found.
p292_417|I will always remember the horrible images.
p292_418|It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.
p292_419|But a surprise is in store.
p292_420|You can cope with it.
p292_421|He was back to square one.
p292_422|We didn't get any from his face.
p292_423|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
p292_424|It's time for a change.
p293_391|I do not believe they are.
p293_392|The aircraft was totally destroyed.
p293_393|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p293_394|She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
p293_395|This is a completely new experience for me.
p293_396|I should never have come over to Fife.
p293_397|What kind of person is he?
p293_398|Their bid was a very good one.
p293_399|Green is desperate to play in The Open.
p293_400|And this tournament will travel.
p294_415|I don't entirely buy that.
p294_416|England could not take anything for granted, however.
p294_417|I saw it in a different way.
p294_418|Or, rather, it isn't.
p294_419|We have every respect for Michelle.
p294_420|Mr Blunkett was convinced.
p294_421|The auction will be held tomorrow.
p294_422|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p294_423|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p294_424|He died at the hands of his captors.
p295_414|How do we get more people in?
p295_415|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
p295_416|There is too much at stake for that.
p295_418|We suspect he was pleased.
p295_419|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
p295_420|But, of course, it isn't.
p295_421|We are almost at that point, but not quite.
p295_422|I have to say, for me, the game was not.
p295_423|The document is a starting point for discussion.
p295_424|There is still the question of his health.
p297_415|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p297_416|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p297_417|This is his personal life.
p297_418|Now he is trying to downgrade the media.
p297_419|Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
p297_420|Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
p297_421|It'`	s the tip of the iceberg.
p297_422|It's a true story.
p297_423|There was a substantial explosion.
p297_424|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p298_396|The woman is basically off her head.
p298_397|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p298_398|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p298_399|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p298_400|The South African defended his work ethic.
p298_401|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
p298_402|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
p298_403|The new work will begin in the autumn.
p298_404|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p298_405|He showed he has some things to learn.
p299_396|I'll take what comes along.
p299_397|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
p299_398|She will just have wanted her baby.
p299_399|Scotland is losing business.
p299_400|We are working on the two things.
p299_401|We only lost the third goal.
p299_402|Women reported more depression than men.
p299_403|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
p299_404|The euro is your money, it is our money.
p299_405|Nothing has been going for us, but what can you do?
p300_391|Form and structure are his music.
p300_392|I don't have any bitterness about it, it's just a fact.
p300_393|Is the Welsh assembly going to go?
p300_394|The award was a lifeline for me.
p300_395|Victory, she insisted yesterday, was far more important than the rewards.
p300_396|For all his successes, he is accustomed to waiting for fulfilment.
p300_397|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p300_398|We expect to come through on Thursday.
p300_399|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
p300_400|Six other people were injured.
p301_402|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p301_403|There was no cohesion.
p301_404|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p301_405|Whether this return was too soon.
p301_406|Jackson may well be right.
p301_407|My thoughts are with their families.
p301_408|I saw some good things.
p301_409|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p301_410|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p301_411|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p302_307|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p302_308|The list is too long for this piece.
p302_309|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p302_310|Entries for the event are still being accepted.
p302_311|It plans to return to this field.
p302_312|However, there was no hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p302_313|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p302_314|Tonight's matches European Championship.
p302_315|It's like the Russians.
p302_316|Is that Titanic?
p303_344|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p303_345|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p303_346|I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
p303_347|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p303_348|I can appear to be nice and lovely.
p303_349|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p303_350|People tended to stay there for some time.
p303_351|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p303_352|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p303_353|This represents a tough game for us.
p304_415|Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
p304_416|He took over our lives.
p304_417|I would think they are just behind them.
p304_418|We would all have liked to run.
p304_419|I can understand why they have gone.
p304_420|That, though, was then.
p304_421|People should not become complacent.
p304_422|I will go out with him any time.
p304_423|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p304_424|Public safety is paramount.
p305_414|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p305_415|She always wanted her own way.
p305_416|But it is all by design.
p305_417|We've still got a say in this.
p305_418|She can't say where she was, what she did.
p305_419|I'll take what comes along.
p305_420|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
p305_421|Women reported more depression than men.
p305_422|The euro is your money, it is our money.
p305_423|Nothing has been going for us, but what can you do?
p306_349|She has seen, or heard, it all.
p306_351|This time, however, there is a new venue.
p306_352|Who has the second highest?
p306_354|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
p306_355|I didn't even have the first idea.
p306_356|No person was charged.
p306_357|I've only met him three times.
p306_358|You see, my back has gone.
p306_359|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p306_360|She looked very, very poor.
p307_414|Now you see him, now you don't.
p307_416|So now this series has had its day.
p307_417|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p307_418|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
p307_419|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p307_420|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p307_421|His views are hardly surprising.
p307_422|His wife Margaret was not in court.
p307_423|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
p307_424|Nobody else was with me.
p308_414|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p308_415|She took them for a term.
p308_416|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
p308_417|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p308_418|Or so she thought.
p308_419|It was another good idea.
p308_420|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p308_421|The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
p308_422|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p308_423|In fact, they should have scored three times.
p310_415|The film is about the cost of genius.
p310_416|They've been here before.
p310_417|I want a free vote.
p310_418|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p310_419|It would show them a positive way forward.
p310_420|I think it's a disgrace.
p310_421|So he should be.
p310_422|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p310_423|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
p310_424|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p311_414|It worked well in Monaco.
p311_415|They were outside the circle.
p311_416|The whole process was so different.
p311_417|He also called in at another farm.
p311_418|I agree with them.
p311_419|I feel very strongly about that.
p311_420|We will listen to colleagues.
p311_421|It's very difficult and very worrying.
p311_422|It's something we want to make work.
p311_423|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
p312_410|He supported the decision to review the decision.
p312_411|It was chaotic and frightening.
p312_412|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p312_413|He will never walk the streets again.
p312_414|The proposals have been taken out of context.
p312_415|Golf has lost a great character.
p312_416|However, it has had only a limited uptake.
p312_417|I have to say, for me, the game was not.
p312_418|However, the report was incorrect.
p312_419|There was no pressure at all.
p313_414|We never agreed to it.
p313_415|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p313_416|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p313_417|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p313_418|Would they work together again?
p313_419|I didn't play all that well.
p313_420|Who can tell?
p313_421|It appears to have been closed down.
p313_422|Now, that is a good deal.
p313_423|The whole nation will be delighted.
p314_414|I don't believe that money is the answer.
p314_415|Jackson may well be right.
p314_416|I am in a very difficult position.
p314_417|They will run in tandem with New Work.
p314_418|As for Owen, class is permanent.
p314_419|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p314_420|My thoughts are with their families.
p314_421|He is not very big, either.
p314_422|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p314_423|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p316_414|We were beaten by the better team.
p316_415|I hope you don't regret it.
p316_416|He was all blackened.
p316_417|This is your country.
p316_418|This is the greatest moment of our lives.
p316_419|Audiences there were shocked.
p316_420|They responded in the most positive way.
p316_421|The British government said she was coming home.
p316_422|We won very easily.
p316_423|That is a matter for Mr Graham.
p317_415|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p317_416|This was not the show for me.
p317_417|The police have to act to help them.
p317_418|She was extremely rigid.
p317_419|Neither side can win this war.
p317_420|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
p317_421|We do not, at the moment, have a shortage.
p317_422|Appointments should be made on merit.
p317_423|Manchester United are the classic example.
p317_424|That is not bigotry.
p318_415|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p318_416|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p318_417|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p318_418|Would they work together again?
p318_419|I didn't play all that well.
p318_420|Who can tell?
p318_421|It appears to have been closed down.
p318_422|Now, that is a good deal.
p318_423|The whole nation will be delighted.
p318_424|We have no plans for direct action.
p323_415|The Dutchman was suspended for two games.
p323_416|There is a spring in the step.
p323_417|It's been a humbling year.
p323_418|We tend to come good at the end.
p323_419|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p323_420|The commission is not the only loser.
p323_421|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
p323_422|I wish it well.
p323_423|Harold is a rarity.
p323_424|I want him to take on Gomez.
p326_391|My father had been unwell for many years.
p326_392|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p326_393|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p326_394|However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
p326_395|It was like the old days.
p326_396|A great deal has been achieved.
p326_397|My future is in the marathon.
p326_398|Then he did it twice.
p326_399|So is the rest of British sport.
p326_400|It had until tomorrow to comply.
p329_415|There was a fine line to tread.
p329_416|Yet it is all for two good causes.
p329_417|It is so elusive and light.
p329_418|Or was it Some kind of a ham?
p329_419|We've come from a long way back.
p329_420|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p329_421|I'll never think of myself as a star.
p329_422|The country is in a state of chaos.
p329_423|What will happen if it all goes wrong?
p329_424|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p330_415|She has now been registered as disabled.
p330_416|You have to work with what you've got.
p330_417|O Leary now intends to take a holiday.
p330_418|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p330_419|This is about the Orange Order.
p330_420|But it looks good for next year.
p330_421|We will do so again.
p330_422|It's been a long, long journey.
p330_423|I have no problem with that.
p330_424|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
p333_415|I want to win this thing.
p333_416|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p333_417|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p333_418|I'd just like to play.
p333_419|They were in good humour, too.
p333_420|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p333_421|Three months or so later, they are returning.
p333_422|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p333_423|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p333_424|Appointed general secretary last September.
p334_415|More likely, perhaps, is that he will stay in England.
p334_416|A great deal has been achieved.
p334_417|Some things in life you have to accept.
p334_418|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
p334_419|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
p334_420|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p334_421|I think it is totally wrong.
p334_422|It's not realistic because it's early days.
p334_423|It is par for the course, isn't it?
p334_424|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
p335_415|I am in a very difficult position.
p335_416|They will run in tandem with New Work.
p335_417|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p335_418|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p335_419|He is not very big, either.
p335_420|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p335_421|But who gets on the tube?
p335_422|We are encouraged by the news.
p335_423|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p335_424|Happily we found it in the library.
p336_415|The auction has seven days to run.
p336_416|It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
p336_417|They want to prove a point.
p336_418|It is my decision and my decision alone.
p336_419|Would he ever go back to the beginning?
p336_420|What is going on?
p336_421|Let that be their memorial.
p336_422|We thought we were looking in good shape.
p336_423|Tonight is very special.
p336_424|This is a matter of life and death.
p339_415|I didn't play badly.
p339_416|We haven't come out of this very well.
p339_417|They are looking for partners.
p339_418|I thought they could have made the gesture.
p339_419|We should have been rewarded for producing.
p339_420|I am also delighted for all the players.
p339_421|He did very well, but didn't win.
p339_422|There is no shortage of questions.
p339_423|Couldn't see the point.
p339_424|Which, in effect, it is.
p340_415|There are two interests in this woodland.
p340_416|I was frustrated here.
p340_417|It is a good result.
p340_418|Are you watching Liverpool?
p340_419|I'll never think of myself as a star.
p340_420|It was one New Year.
p340_421|We made a world record together.
p340_422|Our policy is already working well.
p340_423|I believe we have a good chance.
p340_424|Things were not easy from the outset.
p341_401|I'll take what comes along.
p341_402|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
p341_403|She will just have wanted her baby.
p341_404|Golf has lost a great character.
p341_405|You have to have some hope and faith.
p341_406|They hold on for many years.
p341_407|However, the report was incorrect.
p341_408|Women reported more depression than men.
p341_409|He needs to be.
p341_410|The euro is your money, it is our money.
p343_391|They are there to help us.
p343_392|It just isn't a defining issue for them.
p343_393|You take a risk.
p343_394|Which he is, too.
p343_395|Each one is as good as the other.
p343_396|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p343_397|I have hardly any commitments.
p343_398|There is no formula.
p343_399|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p343_400|I love the feel of the place.
p345_391|There is ample evidence.
p345_392|It was a game we had to win.
p345_393|I've never had problems with any football managers.
p345_394|To begin with it looks good.
p345_395|I won't go back to Holland.
p345_396|There is still a long way to go.
p345_397|Almost overnight, he found his voice.
p345_398|This was a unique election.
p345_399|It was still there last night.
p345_400|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p347_415|What exactly is your job?
p347_416|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p347_417|There's nothing for you here.
p347_418|I grew up listening to these people.
p347_419|They wanted to show what they could do.
p347_420|I just want to get rid of it.
p347_421|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p347_422|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p347_423|I have not come in to take over.
p347_424|Is this accurate?
p351_415|His first album was a hit.
p351_416|The salary changes are long overdue.
p351_417|The plane was shaking.
p351_418|It was visibly on fire.
p351_419|What's it for, after all?
p351_420|We will be pleased to talk to them.
p351_421|A number of people could not speak English.
p351_422|They have got off with murder.
p351_423|I'm going to take it further.
p351_424|I kept going for her.
p364_299|You will be very, very welcome.
p364_300|I really want to win in Glasgow.
p364_301|Is he any good?
p364_302|The proposals have been taken out of context.
p364_303|It was then that Rangers scored.
p364_304|This was repeated the second time.
p364_305|I chose the former.
p364_306|Sub Not Used, McKee.
p364_308|They were very responsive.
p364_309|We're talking to him.
p374_415|Neither could be contacted last night.
p374_416|That clearly wasn't what they wanted.
p374_417|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p374_418|And well he might.
p374_419|They have not been named.
p374_420|It feels like too much.
p374_421|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p374_422|Next year this time  we will be home.
p374_423|That time has passed.
p374_424|It will be crucial.
p376_286|"He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained."
p376_287|"That could change."
p376_288|"He should have won."
p376_289|"Sunday's game was not a trial."
p376_290|"A new school will be built."
p376_291|"I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission."
p376_292|"The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland."
p376_293|"That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients."
p376_294|"He has retired."
p376_295|"It became a book by itself."
