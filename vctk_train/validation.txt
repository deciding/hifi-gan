p225_335|We are in the end game.
p225_336|I came into this world with nothing.
p225_337|But they have the sound.
p225_346|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
p225_347|Boy is the town a mess.
p225_348|Does it matter ?
p225_349|How do you take them away ?
p225_350|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p225_351|After the match, do you ?
p225_352|He was then replaced by Ross.
p226_351|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p226_352|His contract was then not renewed.
p226_353|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p226_354|That is a break with tradition.
p226_355|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p226_356|She is free.
p226_357|I kept going for her.
p226_358|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p226_359|He's very explosive.
p226_360|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p227_383|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p227_384|He is in the queue.
p227_385|The salary changes are long overdue.
p227_386|I do not like to lose.
p227_387|I am a member of the Labour Party staff.
p227_388|There is no deal as yet.
p227_389|In due course the deal was done.
p227_390|Celtic were pleased to help.
p227_391|They will fight for everything.
p227_392|That's not like us at all.
p228_352|I expected these kind of questions.
p228_353|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p228_354|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p228_355|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p228_356|Equity declined to comment.
p228_357|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p228_358|The play is based on a real-life event.
p228_359|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p228_360|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p228_361|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p229_369|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p229_370|He could make it.
p229_371|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p229_373|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p229_374|It is not too late to get on board.
p229_376|It is a simple equation.
p229_377|Talks are progressing.
p229_378|They play together perfectly.
p229_379|It's a long process.
p229_380|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p230_396|What are they for ?
p230_397|Is there a waiting list ?
p230_398|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p230_399|That investment has now been secured.
p230_400|It is a large number.
p230_401|You will not feel a thing.
p230_402|I've never seen a game like it.
p230_404|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p230_405|It was a bank holiday, after all.
p230_406|We're obviously disturbed by this case.
p231_457|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p231_458|She has reached the top of her profession.
p231_459|But he has a lifeline.
p231_460|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p231_461|They were good years for him.
p231_462|Let that be their memorial.
p231_463|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p231_464|Driving has been the key.
p231_465|She has now been registered as disabled.
p231_466|He is well respected by his colleagues.
p232_396|I can lead by example.
p232_397|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p232_398|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
p232_399|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p232_400|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
p232_401|It is legally binding.
p232_402|We knew nothing about it.
p232_403|My house was shaking at the time.
p232_404|This is a huge confidence boost.
p232_405|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
p233_371|We shall not be moved.
p233_373|It was a hit.
p233_374|He's a nice guy.
p233_375|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p233_376|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p233_377|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p233_378|The mood was defiant.
p233_379|Yet the data is compelling.
p233_381|It's just outrageous.
p233_382|The road was closed for several hours.
p234_342|We did something about it.
p234_343|The market is the market.
p234_344|We do not have the papers.
p234_345|However, the devil is in the detail.
p234_346|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
p234_347|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
p234_348|The answer was in space.
p234_349|We are not interested in dividends.
p234_350|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
p234_351|His concern is only for the future.
p236_484|That is the bottom line.
p236_485|It happens on an annual basis.
p236_486|However, he emphasised the bank was satisfied with progress.
p236_487|We have to go for a win.
p236_488|It worked well in Monaco.
p236_489|Something has got to change.
p236_490|I had it before the final.
p236_491|Our fans have been marvellous.
p236_492|The BBC was a disgrace.
p236_493|I would put my money on Peter Donald.
p237_331|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p237_332|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p237_333|He was then replaced by Ross.
p237_334|I saw some good things.
p237_335|He can do no wrong.
p237_337|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p237_338|There was a bit of urgency in the second half.
p237_339|They haven't got a hope.
p237_340|It has moved on in the last week.
p237_341|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p238_440|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p238_441|None of this work is guaranteed.
p238_442|Now we see no mention of rising rates.
p238_443|Still, some additions are inspired.
p238_444|I believe we can handle this okay.
p238_445|The whole experience was uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time.
p238_446|Hard cash is needed now.
p238_447|I stayed away from the defence.
p238_448|Our performance continues to be outstanding.
p238_449|Celtic are simply trying to buy time by not paying the money.
p239_484|Sales have been perfectly buoyant.
p239_485|I was there five months ago.
p239_486|It happened again, and again, and again.
p239_487|It could well be military.
p239_488|Holland won by five wickets.
p239_489|Other casualties were averted by the swift response of the emergency services.
p239_490|They cannot operate without a licence from the local authority.
p239_491|It's unlikely to be renewed.
p239_492|MOVIE stars are public property.
p239_493|I first met him last summer.
p240_361|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p240_362|That is a break with tradition.
p240_363|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p240_364|The council said the house would have to be demolished.
p240_365|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p240_366|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p240_367|As, indeed, they would be.
p240_368|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p240_369|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p240_370|Hartley should know.
p241_352|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p241_353|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p241_354|As, indeed, they would be.
p241_356|It benefits the whole family.
p241_357|Our numbers are small.
p241_358|That would help.
p241_359|So I left.
p241_360|We are looking for perfection.
p241_362|This is a club on the rise.
p241_363|Equity declined to comment.
p243_379|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p243_380|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
p243_381|This is not a small amount of money.
p243_382|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
p243_383|I just felt that I was broken down.
p243_384|What do we do ?
p243_385|Why do it otherwise ?
p243_386|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p243_387|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
p243_388|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
p244_405|It's all been about the basics of the business.
p244_406|There is a demand for it.
p244_407|It's great that it happened in Britain.
p244_408|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p244_409|They are not going the length of the pitch.
p244_410|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p244_411|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p244_412|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p244_413|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p244_414|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
p245_340|There's no place to hide.
p245_341|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p245_342|I'm very lucky.
p245_343|It was forced to divert.
p245_344|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p245_345|He was then replaced by Ross.
p245_346|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p245_347|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p245_348|They should take their mobile phones.
p245_349|It is not like working for a living.
p246_341|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p246_342|They should take their mobile phones.
p246_343|I got a yellow card.
p246_344|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p246_345|He had taken everything from me.
p246_346|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p246_347|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p246_348|Until they came to do it.
p246_349|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p246_350|The pair are very much in love.
p247_459|The damage is all inside.)
p247_460|The boys are mentally focused.)
p247_461|It's because they can't understand the language.)
p247_462|Then came the farewell to Europe.)
p247_463|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.)
p247_464|I'm very passionate about my country.)
p247_465|Phil Mickelson did that last year.)
p247_466|I think it's a great system.)
p247_467|They're just a good retailer.)
p247_468|That should get their attention.)
p248_357|Who was the mystery MP?
p248_358|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p248_359|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p248_360|He could face a jail sentence.
p248_361|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p248_362|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p248_363|They have not done so this season so far.
p248_364|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p248_365|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p248_366|It is legally binding.
p249_332|Who will do it?
p249_335|I must make that clear.
p249_336|The train was on time.
p249_337|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
p249_338|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p249_339|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p249_340|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p249_341|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p249_342|He's a genius.
p249_343|They should take their mobile phones.
p250_477|The chief constable has retired.
p250_478|Well, he is an artist.
p250_479|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p250_480|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p250_481|Their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure.
p250_482|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p250_483|That argument has been won.
p250_484|It was a narrow escape.
p250_485|And rugby fans can help.
p250_486|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p251_350|He did a good job.
p251_351|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
p251_352|Well, it won't.
p251_353|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p251_355|I'm very lucky.
p251_356|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p251_357|The composer will conduct.
p251_359|It is not like working for a living.
p251_360|They got upset.
p251_361|I saw some good things.
p252_391|I've kept him in touch with everything.
p252_392|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p252_393|There's nothing natural left.
p252_394|He could still be President.
p252_395|There's always a case.
p252_396|The new manager must make tough decisions.
p252_397|He has worked hard over the years.
p252_399|It was too difficult.
p252_400|We will miss him against Celtic.
p252_401|I managed to do that.
p253_385|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p253_386|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p253_387|They are good.
p253_388|I'm glad I came.
p253_390|I've had my time.
p253_391|It will take place in July.
p253_392|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p253_394|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p253_397|What would be the point?
p253_399|It might be.
p254_384|The service would also make a massive impact on tourism.
p254_385|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p254_386|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p254_387|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p254_388|They really did a great job.
p254_389|At the last I found a bunker.
p254_390|Yet the data is compelling.
p254_391|Perhaps the time has come to put the cup in a museum.
p254_392|I would have loved to play in an Old Firm.
p254_393|I'm pleased about one thing.
p255_362|I have got a wife to feed.
p255_363|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
p255_364|Not so, it seems.
p255_365|Tell it like it was?
p255_366|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p255_367|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p255_368|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p255_369|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p255_370|They received a reply from their own managers.
p255_371|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p256_301|Our task is to complete the picture.
p256_302|The party lasted all night.
p256_303|It's so awful.
p256_304|It's just not funny!
p256_305|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p256_306|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p256_307|It is no surprise.
p256_308|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p256_309|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p256_310|We have waited a long time for this.
p257_415|We shall be victorious.
p257_416|Rather than answer, she resigned.
p257_417|War is not the action.
p257_418|They said so that I would look good in uniform.
p257_419|It's not about defining styles.
p257_420|One must hope not!
p257_421|It is marvellous.
p257_422|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p257_423|They should not be blamed for it.
p257_424|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p258_395|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p258_396|I suspect the latter.
p258_397|These guys are looking for business.
p258_398|He is on the wrong side.
p258_399|It was a breathtaking moment.
p258_400|The car was just there.
p258_401|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p258_402|It is full-scale.
p258_403|My house was shaking at the time.
p258_404|Then , he laughs.
p259_462|We put our bid in last night.)
p259_463|Quality was high in all sections.)
p259_464|It could cause a little bit of disruption.)
p259_465|But we have built a platform for next season.)
p259_466|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.)
p259_467|They offer a kind of narrative.)
p259_468|She came to the Highland Show.)
p259_469|It was like someone had died.)
p259_470|They were good years for him.)
p259_471|Let that be their memorial.)
p260_338|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p260_339|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p260_340|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p260_341|He was the architect.
p260_342|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p260_343|He has to learn.
p260_344|Two people were interviewed.
p260_345|I've got no secret.
p260_346|This is a big advantage.
p260_347|I'm very lucky.
p261_455|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p261_456|Paris is not only young.
p261_457|No one wants to go through these things.
p261_458|Our legal advice is clear.
p261_459|It all began as an accident.
p261_460|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
p261_461|It might be useful to have something in black and white.
p261_462|They were totally behind it.
p261_463|Let that be their memorial.
p261_464|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p262_375|I am a wealthy person.
p262_376|Something is wrong.
p262_377|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p262_378|I am very happy with life.
p262_379|I was so nervous.
p262_380|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p262_381|However, it's good to turn the page.
p262_382|It would be a massive boost for them.
p262_383|The release attracted little attention.
p262_384|It was important to win the singles.
p263_454|Legal opinion is that I may have a case.
p263_455|However, one has arrived in the post.
p263_456|They offer a kind of narrative.
p263_457|He looked on the deal as a merger rather than a takeover.
p263_458|He doesn't like the Labour Party.
p263_459|It goes with the job.
p263_460|It has been a waste of time.
p263_461|The rest of the business is very robust.
p263_462|I saw it didn't work.
p263_463|To tell the truth, it wasn't a good game.
p264_476|Tell us about it.)
p264_477|The child has denied murder.)
p264_478|The union has threatened strike action unless these demands are met.)
p264_479|We were given a break.)
p264_480|The first four teams were all inside the previous record.)
p264_481|The parties include the Scottish Executive.)
p264_482|I'd like my TV programmes to be simple, but not too simple.)
p264_483|Your bank may offer you a choice of options.)
p264_484|That is surely worth a try.)
p264_485|I believe in theatre.)
p265_333|The pair are very much in love.
p265_334|As, indeed, they would be.
p265_335|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p265_336|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p265_337|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p265_338|That would help.
p265_339|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p265_340|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p265_341|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p265_342|There was a substantial explosion.
p266_405|I knew the script.
p266_406|They were kept there for a summer.
p266_407|The weekly average was three hours.
p266_408|Relief was beyond belief.
p266_409|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p266_410|He got his degree.
p266_411|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p266_412|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p266_413|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p266_414|But we finished the show.
p267_402|Is there a waiting list ?
p267_403|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p267_404|You thought it was a headache.
p267_405|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p267_406|I thought he was an animal.
p267_407|None of the agencies was able to help.
p267_408|We will stand for the nation.
p267_409|I'm pleased about one thing.
p267_410|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p267_411|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p268_392|Potions said he would drive.
p268_393|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
p268_394|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p268_395|It is sending the wrong message to people.
p268_396|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p268_397|You can feel at home in China.
p268_398|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p268_399|It seems to have worked.
p268_400|We have no information on Iraq.
p268_401|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p269_383|They haven't got a hope.
p269_384|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
p269_385|He denied the charge.
p269_386|You can cope with it.
p269_387|I am very happy with life.
p269_388|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p269_389|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p269_391|If you look at the other galleries in this area.
p269_392|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
p269_393|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p270_443|They are interior designers and architects.
p270_444|It shows the right amount of progress.
p270_445|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
p270_446|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
p270_447|It was to be inclusive.
p270_448|No further details of expansion plans were given.
p270_449|The budget was too low for that.
p270_450|Our legal advice is clear.
p270_451|Striking the deal has come as a big relief.
p270_452|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p271_435|It is not either national standards or local control.
p271_436|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
p271_437|We are all equal.
p271_438|Admission is free.
p271_439|We are now up against it.
p271_440|In it went.
p271_441|We were used.
p271_442|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p271_443|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p271_444|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p272_393|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p272_394|It was a kind of contempt.
p272_395|It was a breathtaking moment.
p272_396|The car was just there.
p272_397|It will take place in July.
p272_398|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p272_399|Is that possible?
p272_400|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p272_401|What was the difference between them?
p272_402|Emotions were complex.
p273_417|There is a solution, she believes.
p273_418|That might mean another delay.
p273_419|That's been all around Europe with me.
p273_420|She's had to suffer for the last six years.
p273_421|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p273_422|My aim is a top six finish.
p273_423|That means that nobody can do it.
p273_424|Such an attack is bizarre.
p273_425|At half-time he was presented to both teams.
p273_426|No date has been fixed for his return.
p274_451|It could cause a little bit of disruption.)
p274_452|But we have built a platform for next season.)
p274_453|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.)
p274_454|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.)
p274_455|It was like someone had died.)
p274_456|They offer a kind of narrative.)
p274_457|We're still the only ones in the High Street.)
p274_458|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.)
p274_459|Now that business is banned.)
p274_460|Let that be their memorial.)
p275_409|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p275_410|We went straight into the bedroom.
p275_411|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p275_413|I am extremely cautious.
p275_414|Paris is not only young.
p275_415|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p275_416|He is to appeal.
p275_417|It all began as an accident.
p275_418|We have to expand.
p275_419|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
p276_446|He was due to retire in December.
p276_447|We go there with confidence.
p276_448|They are interior designers and architects.
p276_449|He was released after treatment.
p276_450|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p276_451|When I was four years old I used to do like this.
p276_452|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
p276_453|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
p276_454|They must play for each other.
p276_455|We are aiming for early March.
p277_444|I was lost.
p277_445|The children are fine.
p277_446|They have to come up with a solution.
p277_447|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p277_448|The whole region is in shock.
p277_449|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p277_450|It was a total disaster.
p277_451|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p277_452|I got a yellow card.
p277_453|Stewart was the life and soul of the party.
p278_391|One-third of the places are already taken.
p278_392|I always knew she was funny.
p278_393|The marshall at the turn was great.
p278_394|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
p278_395|They have not got anyone.
p278_396|The law would appear to be on our side.
p278_397|It has happened for generations.
p278_398|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
p278_399|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p278_400|There's still no-one like him.
p279_387|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
p279_388|I was in jail for five years.
p279_389|It will take place in July.
p279_390|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p279_391|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p279_392|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p279_393|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p279_394|He's already made history.
p279_395|So I did.
p279_396|You ask the question.
p280_391|My tax affairs have been totally open.
p280_392|Five years ago its return was rejected.
p280_393|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
p280_394|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
p280_395|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
p280_396|We are keen to see truth and justice.
p280_397|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p280_398|People have a wish to charge twice.
p280_399|I think it's a big advantage to us.
p280_400|There were no hard words between us.
p281_441|He deserves a second chance.
p281_442|It is pretty bad news.
p281_443|We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.
p281_444|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p281_445|We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
p281_446|But we have built a platform for next season.
p281_447|I was embarrassed by it.
p281_448|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p281_449|She came to the Highland Show.
p281_450|Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
p282_351|My husband was angry.
p282_352|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p282_353|And he laughs.
p282_354|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p282_355|This is a club on the rise.
p282_356|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p282_357|Their time has gone.
p282_358|He could make it.
p282_359|The death rates are still as high.
p282_360|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p283_452|But we have built a platform for next season.
p283_453|I was embarrassed by it.
p283_454|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p283_455|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
p283_456|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p283_457|I'd never run for them.
p283_458|She came to the Highland Show.
p283_459|He was confronted by police.
p283_460|I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
p283_461|She has reached the top of her profession.
p284_406|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p284_407|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p284_408|It is full-scale.
p284_409|Then , he laughs.
p284_410|You know the sort of thing.
p284_411|I knew the script.
p284_412|It might be.
p284_413|Feel the air, the space.
p284_414|He scored a touchdown.
p284_415|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p285_384|It's just outrageous.
p285_385|They deserved the win.
p285_386|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p285_387|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p285_388|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p285_389|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p285_390|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p285_391|They are good.
p285_392|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p285_393|But we are a young side.
p286_449|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president Jim Walker welcomed the new proposals.
p286_450|We make this offer to the parliament.
p286_451|The jury is still out.
p286_452|No further details of expansion plans were given.
p286_453|He was said to be emotionally disturbed.
p286_454|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p286_455|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p286_456|They were good years for him.
p286_457|It was his job to check.
p286_458|The boys are mentally focused.
p287_405|It's too close to call.
p287_406|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p287_407|I decided to take my time.
p287_408|FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
p287_409|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p287_410|That is the ultimate revenge.
p287_411|It certainly appeared that way.
p287_412|They are looking for profit.
p287_413|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p287_414|YOU thought it was a headache.
p288_393|It is not normal practice.
p288_394|This is a major step forward for carers.
p288_395|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p288_396|My house was shaking at the time.
p288_397|Emotions were complex.
p288_398|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p288_399|He's already made history.
p288_400|Then , he laughs.
p288_401|You ask the question.
p288_402|That is not in the interests of anyone or any party.
p292_405|Clark is back on top form.
p292_406|A suspicion was not enough.
p292_407|It will probably be my last, too.
p292_408|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
p292_409|It is good for Europe.
p292_410|I am looking forward to this film.
p292_411|Colour was at the core of his life.
p292_412|They would not tell us.
p292_413|The balance is all wrong in this country.
p292_414|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p293_381|When he took over it really took off.
p293_382|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p293_383|The penalty was the turning point.
p293_384|I have chosen to do this research.
p293_385|It was even worse than at home.
p293_386|Michael's putting on a brave face.
p293_387|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
p293_388|I am sure that this will happen again.
p293_389|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p293_390|All were within range of Israeli cities.
p294_405|It's a tragedy for the area.
p294_406|It was very well received.
p294_407|I don't think there's going to be one.
p294_408|If you could find it.
p294_409|Such is the ego involved.
p294_410|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
p294_411|It raises the edge.
p294_412|It was not known to myself.
p294_413|It is a delight on every level.
p294_414|Would it really be good to shorten it?
p295_404|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p295_405|I am not retiring.
p295_406|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p295_407|Boy is the town a mess.
p295_408|Barry will be able to handle this.
p295_409|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
p295_410|To me, it was just a miracle.
p295_411|After that, though, we are still waiting to see.
p295_412|That can happen so easily.
p295_413|This is a really serious issue.
p297_405|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p297_406|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p297_407|One policeman was killed.
p297_408|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p297_409|My heart is not so sure.
p297_410|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
p297_411|You have to rely on each other.
p297_412|However, it was well worth the wait.
p297_413|It is a thing of beauty to watch.
p297_414|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
p298_386|This is a long-term discussion paper.
p298_387|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p298_388|The damage from the fire was huge.
p298_389|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p298_390|But we'll just keep trying to get results.
p298_391|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p298_392|We have to offer value for money.
p298_393|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
p298_394|However, in October another partnership was announced.
p298_395|I am just looking to God.
p299_386|It was meant to rival the dollar.
p299_387|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
p299_388|She always wanted her own way.
p299_389|Maybe, who knows?
p299_390|And the funny thing is, they usually do.
p299_391|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
p299_392|It was a sell-out.
p299_393|We welcome the proposals, but they must get on with it.
p299_394|If there is default.
p299_395|She can't say where she was, what she did.
p300_381|Who is going to pay their wages?
p300_382|There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.
p300_383|Even then he was in the media spotlight.
p300_384|But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
p300_385|That's the kind of thing that counts.
p300_386|Construction would then begin.
p300_387|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p300_388|A century on, little has changed.
p300_389|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p300_390|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p301_392|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p301_393|McMaster had already seen the first part.
p301_394|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p301_395|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
p301_396|It was early morning.
p301_397|Partition is not an option.
p301_398|What other retailer would do this?
p301_399|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p301_400|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p301_401|I won't go back to Holland.
p302_297|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p302_298|It all seemed so easy.
p302_299|I really don't understand what is happening.
p302_300|The frustration was showing.
p302_301|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p302_302|I am a wealthy person.
p302_303|My friends were very envious.
p302_304|The snipers are also out.
p302_305|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p302_306|We are determined to establish the facts.
p303_334|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p303_335|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
p303_336|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p303_337|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
p303_338|I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
p303_339|Some of his family still live there.
p303_340|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p303_341|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p303_342|I get to work with very good people.
p303_343|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p304_405|He said it was his greatest work.
p304_406|The baby deserves the credit.
p304_407|They are different types.
p304_408|Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.
p304_409|We are not too surprised.
p304_410|They are not a set of options.
p304_411|But it was money well spent.
p304_412|They would never let him go.
p304_413|Which is worse?
p304_414|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p305_404|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
p305_405|The surprise is its product is so poor.
p305_406|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
p305_407|See it while you can.
p305_408|I didn't do too badly myself.
p305_409|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p305_410|He has never even been to Ireland.
p305_411|We believe the squad will stay together.
p305_412|Such people do not exist.
p305_413|We suspect he was pleased.
p306_339|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p306_340|Well, was it?
p306_341|We won't let you down.
p306_342|What kind of person is he?
p306_343|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
p306_344|He was visited by UK consular officials.
p306_345|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
p306_346|English is the language of pop music.
p306_347|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p306_348|It is a simple equation.
p307_403|There was no cohesion.
p307_404|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p307_405|Whether this return was too soon.
p307_406|Jackson may well be right.
p307_407|My thoughts are with their families.
p307_408|I saw some good things.
p307_410|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p307_411|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p307_412|But who gets on the tube?
p307_413|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p308_404|I leave tonight for England.
p308_405|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p308_406|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
p308_407|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p308_408|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
p308_409|I have no argument with Scotland.
p308_410|There are simply no orders.
p308_411|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
p308_412|Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
p308_413|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p310_405|And that started me thinking.
p310_406|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p310_407|It brings together two essential elements.
p310_408|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
p310_409|We had a reunion last week.
p310_410|This will help our confidence.
p310_411|We have high hopes that this will work.
p310_412|They also have good neighbours.
p310_413|People ask about the concept of a team.
p310_414|Who has he fought?
p311_404|We're not the tourist board.
p311_405|It was the same old story.
p311_406|I was frustrated here.
p311_407|We have reacted well to each other.
p311_408|Are you watching Liverpool?
p311_409|I was furious about it.
p311_410|This will be no easy option.
p311_411|They knew they shouldn't have been there.
p311_412|Of course we aren't.
p311_413|We haven't been told.
p312_400|Do what you have to do.
p312_401|We must do well in that.
p312_402|She died later on Monday.
p312_403|No-one has yet been charged.
p312_404|If so, they were wrong.
p312_405|This is my big break.
p312_406|It was meant to rival the dollar.
p312_407|There is no easy answer.
p312_408|There was someone on the floor.
p312_409|I put pressure on him.
p313_404|I will never manage another Scottish club.
p313_405|The Open champion is back.
p313_406|It's going to be a new challenge.
p313_407|As, indeed, they would be.
p313_408|I want to keep him.
p313_409|He deserves a top team.
p313_410|I knew people on that committee.
p313_411|The next eight weeks are critical to us.
p313_412|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
p313_413|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p314_404|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p314_405|You name it, they have it.
p314_406|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
p314_407|The review has been conducted fairly.
p314_408|There is no smoking gun.
p314_409|We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.
p314_410|He feels he has cost us the game, but he didn't.
p314_411|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p314_412|It is a natural reaction.
p314_413|Whether this return was too soon.
p316_404|Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
p316_405|I am glad that justice has been done.
p316_406|Its first awards will just do that.
p316_407|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p316_408|That is my preference.
p316_409|Taxation should be simplified.
p316_410|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p316_411|It is not that sort of inquiry.
p316_412|I have signed a contract.
p316_413|I have never been overly ambitious.
p317_405|And our game is about going forward.
p317_406|They will have to cut through the roof.
p317_407|Then there's one where people play for fun.
p317_408|That's the law of the land.
p317_409|They have enough intrusion at the time.
p317_410|What's wrong with that?
p317_411|This wasn't something we wanted to rush into.
p317_412|Then one night only three people turn up.
p317_413|The parents will have a great time, too.
p317_414|Now we see the impact of global politics.
p318_405|The Open champion is back.
p318_406|It's going to be a new challenge.
p318_407|As, indeed, they would be.
p318_408|I want to keep him.
p318_409|He deserves a top team.
p318_410|I knew people on that committee.
p318_411|The next eight weeks are critical to us.
p318_412|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
p318_413|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p318_414|We never agreed to it.
p323_405|The house was full of smoke.
p323_406|A decision about that will be made today.
p323_407|The early evidence suggests he did not.
p323_408|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p323_409|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p323_410|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p323_411|We are seeking funds from government departments.
p323_412|Last night, the row continued.
p323_413|That, though, was again according to manager McCall.
p323_414|Now it's all written down.
p326_381|Therein lies the problem.
p326_382|You feel the pride.
p326_383|But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
p326_384|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p326_385|I have to keep working hard.
p326_386|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p326_387|Art is still a risky investment.
p326_388|That is difficult to answer.
p326_389|A century on, little has changed.
p326_390|Wrong decisions Address in full
p329_405|They've been here before.
p329_406|I want a free vote.
p329_407|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p329_408|It would show them a positive way forward.
p329_409|Players were held in equally low regard.
p329_410|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p329_411|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
p329_412|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p329_413|They have the cash to do that.
p329_414|He was not seeking special advantage.
p330_405|We didn't know if people would turn up.
p330_406|We will deal with the refugees.
p330_407|I am greatly encouraged.
p330_408|They offer a kind of narrative.
p330_409|You guys are not out of it yet.
p330_410|What does he want him to look like?
p330_411|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
p330_412|What is next?
p330_413|Their welfare is very important to us.
p330_414|It's nothing to do with me.
p333_405|They hold on for many years.
p333_406|After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
p333_407|However, there are signs of dissent among his collies.
p333_408|There's nothing for you here.
p333_409|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p333_410|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p333_411|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p333_412|I have not come in to take over.
p333_413|Is this accurate?
p333_414|A judicial review is also being considered.
p334_405|It's the same as Glasgow.
p334_406|This seems like a very good idea.
p334_407|My wife and family are the support system.
p334_408|It remains in public ownership.
p334_409|The Master was by then just too old.
p334_410|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
p334_411|He added, We are not prepared for war.
p334_412|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p334_413|The hangover was Olympian.
p334_414|We are here for the long term.
p335_405|You name it, they have it.
p335_406|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
p335_407|There was no cohesion.
p335_408|There is no going back.
p335_409|We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.
p335_410|Courtenay took over on tour.
p335_411|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p335_412|The game is now open.
p335_413|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p335_414|Jackson may well be right.
p336_404|But we say Yes - and we are the people.
p336_405|Is it any good?
p336_406|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p336_407|It would be that absurd.
p336_408|As if he would.
p336_409|I just carry on with my work.
p336_410|She made no further comment.
p336_411|His attacker has been a Rangers fan.
p336_412|He wants the festival to make a difference.
p336_413|He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.
p339_405|We await a decision.
p339_406|It's a matter of balance.
p339_407|It is an investment in our product.
p339_408|Everyone can have their opinion.
p339_409|What would you ask?
p339_410|We have got to deal with it.
p339_411|Where do we spend it?
p339_412|I don't know how she does it.
p339_413|I saw it later in the news.
p339_414|Now we must look to the future.
p340_405|He said no survivors had been found.
p340_406|It is the end of an era.
p340_407|We shall not do that.
p340_408|My daughter was really, really innocent.
p340_409|It will not be easy.
p340_410|Once again, he refused.
p340_411|And it will be a challenge.
p340_412|And Scotland is no different.
p340_413|The power of religion is so strong.
p340_414|It means a huge amount.
p341_391|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p341_392|There was someone on the floor.
p341_393|Story time is over - it's a war.
p341_394|Maybe, who knows?
p341_395|However, this idea is never developed.
p341_396|But it is all by design.
p341_397|It was a sell-out.
p341_398|We've still got a say in this.
p341_399|Things are going very well.
p341_400|She can't say where she was, what she did.
p343_381|It has happened, and that is the end of the story.
p343_382|We don't do this for everyone, of course.
p343_383|And there is another problem.
p343_384|That is the theory.
p343_385|It almost certainly is.
p343_386|They will have five minutes to decide.
p343_387|Because it's a secret.
p343_388|My wife and family are the support system.
p343_389|The body follows the mind.
p343_390|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
p345_381|McMaster had already seen the first part.
p345_382|Or is it?
p345_383|Is he going to look after them?
p345_384|They are appealing for witnesses.
p345_385|This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
p345_386|It is quite simple.
p345_387|My whole life has changed.
p345_388|But perhaps it was all for the best.
p345_389|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p345_390|His instructions were clear.
p347_405|In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
p347_406|I believe in God.
p347_407|Which means it matters.
p347_408|There is great potential on this river.
p347_409|We can't win a big game.
p347_410|It was a stunning strike.
p347_411|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p347_412|She said he showed no remorse.
p347_413|We are going through difficult times.
p347_414|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p351_405|But is he?
p351_406|So it's a daily struggle.
p351_407|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p351_408|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
p351_409|Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
p351_410|Everyone has his share of trouble.
p351_411|You need a licence to run a pub.
p351_412|Everything else is second.
p351_413|I am not sure.
p351_414|This is a successful outcome.
p364_287|It does and it doesn't.
p364_288|It will not be today, though.
p364_289|We suspect he was pleased.
p364_290|I have been here for only three months.
p364_291|We have no knowledge of this.
p364_292|I was the willing journeyman.
p364_293|I know we ask a lot of you.
p364_294|When he got up he was hit again.
p364_297|It was just one man.
p364_298|It's going to be tough.
p374_405|They have not given them the evidence.
p374_406|We need to chat.
p374_407|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
p374_408|That was never their agenda.
p374_409|I certainly will not settle.
p374_410|He said it was the worst possible result.
p374_411|It's very tragic and traumatic.
p374_412|It's always the same, isn't it?
p374_413|I don't make it mystical.
p374_414|So what was he really doing?
p376_275|"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast."
p376_276|"Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident."
p376_277|"You've got to have both sides."
p376_278|"Who will perform?"
p376_279|"The death toll included five children."
p376_280|"Parents should avoid it."
p376_282|"Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people."
p376_283|"It happens from time to time."
p376_284|"He was obviously very genuine."
p376_285|"It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland."
