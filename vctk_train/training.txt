p225_001|Please call Stella.
p225_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p225_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p225_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p225_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p225_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p225_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p225_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p225_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p225_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p225_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p225_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p225_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p225_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p225_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p225_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p225_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p225_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p225_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p225_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p225_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p225_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p225_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p225_025|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p225_026|How are you, sir ?
p225_027|So is that it, then ?
p225_028|Do I have a favourite ?
p225_029|What do we do ?
p225_030|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p225_033|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
p225_035|A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
p225_036|It was a close call.
p225_037|In fact, they are the future of investment.
p225_038|Diving is no part of football.
p225_039|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p225_040|You'd better believe it.
p225_044|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p225_045|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
p225_046|No details of the talks were given.
p225_049|I have learned from him.
p225_051|We are committed to the ban.
p225_052|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p225_053|I have made that offer.
p225_054|Four other charges were dropped.
p225_056|Clearly, it can go either way.
p225_057|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
p225_058|However, the problem is the timing.
p225_059|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
p225_060|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p225_061|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p225_062|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p225_063|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p225_064|It could take some time.
p225_065|There is no pressure on us.
p225_066|It is a job creation scheme.
p225_067|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p225_070|That is bound to happen.
p225_071|He is in the queue.
p225_072|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p225_073|So, did she meet him ?
p225_081|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p225_082|That view is held by many others within the industry.
p225_083|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p225_084|He is delighted, and he has every right to be.
p225_086|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p225_089|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p225_090|I did not have a bet on myself.
p225_092|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p225_094|That's as it should be.
p225_103|Everyone deserves to share in this success.
p225_104|His is a success story by any standard.
p225_108|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p225_109|That might help a bit.
p225_110|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p225_111|It isn't a happy memory.
p225_113|The big issue for us is the review.
p225_114|I told him I was a long time ago.
p225_115|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p225_116|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p225_117|We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.
p225_118|We suffered a lot for seven years.
p225_120|The industry is not well organised.
p225_121|You get a lot for your money.
p225_122|I didn't feel under any pressure.
p225_123|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p225_124|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p225_126|The squad is too small.
p225_127|It is a common problem.
p225_128|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p225_131|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
p225_133|I think he's the favourite.
p225_135|We have seen a copy of the report.
p225_136|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
p225_141|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
p225_142|Well, you can have a tree.
p225_143|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
p225_144|She will do for me.
p225_145|Why change it ?
p225_147|Does the name matter ?
p225_149|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
p225_150|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p225_151|Nothing has been put into action.
p225_152|The weather forecast isn't good.
p225_153|We have a clean bill of health.
p225_156|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p225_157|He was asked to quit.
p225_158|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p225_159|Neither side can win this war.
p225_165|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p225_166|Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.
p225_169|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
p225_171|The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.
p225_172|Nobody did in those days.
p225_173|But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.
p225_174|He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
p225_175|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
p225_176|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p225_177|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p225_179|They know no other way.
p225_182|We are just glad to be alive.
p225_191|People will ask about us.
p225_192|However, this idea is never developed.
p225_193|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p225_195|It is hard to tell.
p225_196|I think, therefore I am ?
p225_197|Who was she ?
p225_199|And they were being paid ?
p225_200|It looked like a river.
p225_201|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
p225_202|The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year.
p225_203|They have the cash and the fire power.
p225_208|You are a great player.
p225_210|Scotland will play its part.
p225_211|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
p225_212|After that nothing could save him.
p225_218|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p225_219|They did not attack the themes of the book.
p225_220|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p225_221|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p225_222|In each case they were a goal down.
p225_223|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p225_224|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p225_225|It is good for our team.
p225_235|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
p225_236|That will be the criteria for the future.
p225_237|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
p225_238|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p225_239|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
p225_240|We are in the hat.
p225_241|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p225_242|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p225_243|The irony was not lost.
p225_244|What was the matter for concern ?
p225_248|Does that put pressure on us ?
p225_253|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p225_254|The problem was a social problem.
p225_257|My son was too young to die.
p225_258|We were not allowed to go to help them.
p225_264|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p225_265|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p225_266|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
p225_268|I realised I was lucky to have it.
p225_273|He has not created a Festival resource.
p225_274|We have not reached the point of no return.
p225_275|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p225_276|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p225_277|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p225_279|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p225_280|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p225_281|They were not at the property yesterday.
p225_282|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.
p225_285|We have to break that cycle.
p225_286|I wanted to change the formula.
p225_287|She said the charity would continue to monitor the case.
p225_289|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p225_290|Scotch beef is badly missed.
p225_291|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p225_293|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p225_294|However, we had no failures in our side.
p225_295|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p225_296|It goes back a long way.
p225_297|Innocent people have a right to live in safety.
p225_298|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p225_299|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
p225_300|I can hardly believe it.
p225_301|I must do something about it.
p225_302|Three hours later, the man was free.
p225_303|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
p225_305|Cast Away now on general release.
p225_308|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p225_309|Are they free ?
p225_310|What are they for ?
p225_312|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p225_314|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p225_315|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p225_316|It is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy.
p225_317|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
p225_318|The problem was he thought you were a big man.
p225_319|There's still a bit to go.
p225_320|We have a good healthy debate.
p225_322|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p225_323|It is a court case.
p225_324|There is no plan B.
p225_325|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p225_326|He will go a long way.
p225_328|It is just a tax on employment.
p225_329|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p225_330|We are a peaceful people.
p225_331|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p225_332|It's difficult to predict the future.
p225_334|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p226_001|Please call Stella.
p226_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p226_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p226_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p226_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p226_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p226_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p226_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p226_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p226_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p226_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p226_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p226_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p226_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p226_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p226_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p226_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p226_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p226_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p226_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p226_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p226_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p226_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p226_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p226_025|He has not been named.
p226_026|That's no bad thing.
p226_027|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p226_028|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p226_029|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p226_030|Because we do not need it.
p226_031|This is the window.
p226_032|I was an athlete.
p226_033|From that day on we started to look for another full back.
p226_034|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p226_036|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p226_037|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p226_039|It has failed.
p226_040|It was clear.
p226_041|It is not for any other purpose.
p226_042|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p226_043|Is there a new way forward?
p226_044|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p226_045|This represents a tough game for us.
p226_046|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p226_047|We need to chat.
p226_048|It's a blessing.
p226_049|But it might have done.
p226_050|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p226_051|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p226_052|It is the whole package.
p226_053|He had no enemies.
p226_054|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p226_055|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p226_056|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p226_057|It's the big omission.
p226_058|Next league matches Celtic.
p226_059|She's a spy!
p226_060|It is unique.
p226_061|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p226_062|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p226_063|It's a real challenge.
p226_064|It is not great art.
p226_065|You do not change overnight.
p226_066|Art is extra.
p226_067|It's a matter of balance.
p226_068|Scotland had great assets.
p226_069|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p226_070|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p226_071|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p226_072|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p226_073|The script was funny.
p226_074|You need a trademark.
p226_075|Painful, but only because it's true.
p226_076|Help is needed.
p226_077|Tommy is not a problem.
p226_078|There could be a way back.
p226_079|Neither it is.
p226_080|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p226_082|It is a terrible place.
p226_083|It works for us.
p226_084|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p226_085|It can be halted.
p226_086|This is the way things should be handled.
p226_088|Detection is often difficult.
p226_089|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p226_090|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p226_091|Someone who cares
p226_092|It's just awful.
p226_093|It's never too late.
p226_094|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p226_095|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p226_096|However, it did not end that way.
p226_097|We could not get any possession.
p226_098|If you could find it.
p226_099|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p226_100|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p226_101|It was mayhem.
p226_102|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p226_103|They were outside the circle.
p226_104|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p226_105|May not have been at fault?
p226_106|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p226_107|It was a good performance.
p226_108|That time is not now, however.
p226_109|Oil embargo endorsed.
p226_110|Before the game we went for a pint.
p226_111|It was an adventure.
p226_112|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p226_113|The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this.
p226_114|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p226_115|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p226_116|It is normal.
p226_117|I don't have many friends.
p226_118|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p226_119|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p226_120|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p226_121|Maybe this battle has been.
p226_122|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p226_124|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p226_125|She's got to say something.
p226_126|It is a delight on every level.
p226_127|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p226_128|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p226_129|She has been shot.
p226_130|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p226_131|I was furious.
p226_132|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p226_133|She really suffered for her art.
p226_134|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p226_135|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p226_136|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p226_137|It will be too hot.
p226_138|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p226_139|I am now unemployed.
p226_140|They made such decisions in London.
p226_141|Our intentions are real.
p226_142|Government will intervene.
p226_143|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p226_144|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p226_145|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p226_146|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p226_148|Three penalties were given.
p226_149|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p226_150|We just had a go.
p226_151|We have seen a copy of the report.
p226_152|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p226_153|That group reported just before Christmas.
p226_154|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p226_155|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p226_156|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p226_157|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
p226_158|We will turn the corner.
p226_159|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p226_160|They should stop the bombing.
p226_161|These days are long gone.
p226_162|It is an attitude of mind.
p226_163|I've learned from my mistakes.
p226_164|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p226_165|We have to move forward.
p226_166|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p226_167|They will do their own thing.
p226_168|It is too much for me.
p226_169|Nobody did in those days.
p226_171|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p226_172|It became a book by itself.
p226_173|His team management was protective.
p226_174|It's quite a routine.
p226_175|It is not either national standards or local control.
p226_176|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p226_177|I took the gun.
p226_178|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p226_179|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p226_180|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p226_181|I've been there.
p226_183|I have no sympathy with her at all.
p226_184|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p226_185|It is not fair.
p226_186|It just came into my head that day.
p226_187|I had a train to catch.
p226_188|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p226_189|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p226_190|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p226_191|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p226_192|People will ask about us.
p226_193|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p226_194|It is a case of taking a risk.
p226_195|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p226_197|There was no option.
p226_198|Is that it?
p226_199|We live by the rule of law.
p226_200|Is that success?
p226_201|The service from the other players was super.
p226_202|They are in the euro.
p226_203|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p226_204|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p226_205|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p226_206|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p226_207|It's a mixture of everything.
p226_208|I don't want to use it.
p226_209|Now, it's all right.
p226_210|It's like a garage.
p226_211|But I am a worried man.
p226_212|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
p226_213|Feel the heat?
p226_214|I'm pleased about one thing.
p226_215|I am delighted for Simon.
p226_216|His third goal was superb.
p226_217|It's not ideal.
p226_218|I was so nervous.
p226_219|I might come back.
p226_220|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p226_221|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p226_223|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p226_224|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p226_225|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p226_226|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p226_227|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p226_228|I am immensely sad.
p226_229|I'd never seen a play about me.
p226_230|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p226_231|The track is currently covered in snow.
p226_232|My wife and family are the support system.
p226_233|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p226_234|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p226_235|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p226_236|It is set in Paris.
p226_237|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p226_238|Hospitals are for the ill.
p226_239|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p226_240|She is well balanced.
p226_241|They are all bright and different.
p226_242|It's only fair.
p226_243|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p226_244|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p226_245|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p226_246|His body was never found.
p226_247|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p226_248|I was shocked.
p226_249|I should think so, too.
p226_251|There's the mix.
p226_252|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p226_253|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p226_254|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p226_255|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p226_256|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p226_257|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p226_258|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p226_259|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p226_260|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p226_261|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p226_262|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p226_263|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p226_264|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p226_265|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p226_266|The warning is timely.
p226_267|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p226_268|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p226_269|They are never here.
p226_270|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
p226_271|He was popular.
p226_272|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p226_273|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p226_274|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p226_276|It's a way of life.
p226_278|I feel pretty good.
p226_279|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p226_280|He has a wealth of experience.
p226_281|It happens from time to time.
p226_283|He looked very sharp.
p226_284|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p226_285|It was a virus.
p226_286|Yet, it worked.
p226_287|Who will perform?
p226_288|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p226_289|This is a national crisis.
p226_290|Scotland were beaten again.
p226_291|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p226_292|It goes back a long way.
p226_293|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p226_294|The results are sometimes contentious.
p226_295|He should have won.
p226_296|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p226_297|There's a pause.
p226_298|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p226_299|There was no hint of scandal.
p226_300|I thought it was my only chance.
p226_301|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p226_302|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p226_303|One was a lawyer.
p226_304|Our task is to complete the picture.
p226_305|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p226_306|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p226_307|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p226_308|This is a war over our home.
p226_309|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p226_310|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p226_311|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p226_312|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p226_313|The minister is the engineer.
p226_314|I did not name it.
p226_315|It was a question of patience.
p226_316|The whole region is in shock.
p226_317|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p226_318|Kids are terrible.
p226_319|Craig is a major concern for us.
p226_320|The home team had an amazing start.
p226_321|My body is clearly capable.
p226_322|Referees are easy targets.
p226_323|He said she was mad.
p226_324|We are in the end game.
p226_325|I am very happy to be here.
p226_326|The airport was even different.
p226_327|We do the same.
p226_328|That's the law of the land.
p226_329|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p226_330|The weekly average was three hours.
p226_331|Donald was his friend.
p226_332|I am so upset.
p226_333|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p226_334|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p226_335|The boat was fantastic.
p226_336|It is a time bomb.
p226_337|I'd like to take the plunge.
p226_338|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p226_339|My view has now completely changed.
p226_340|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p226_341|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p226_342|Three years ago he would have been.
p226_343|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p226_344|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p226_345|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p226_346|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p226_347|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
p226_348|Look at the witnesses.
p226_349|He's been the key to everything.
p226_350|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p227_001|Please call Stella.
p227_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p227_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p227_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p227_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p227_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p227_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p227_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p227_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p227_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p227_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p227_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p227_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p227_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p227_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p227_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p227_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain.
p227_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p227_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p227_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p227_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p227_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p227_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p227_025|Meetings will also remain private.
p227_026|Movement has to take place.
p227_027|I feel I did not have enough time.
p227_028|We will look into it.
p227_029|This is a central issue.
p227_030|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p227_031|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p227_032|There, you were just a body.
p227_033|It is not for any other purpose.
p227_034|President Bush is at war.
p227_035|I became a widow overnight.
p227_036|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p227_037|This represents a tough game for us.
p227_038|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p227_039|Among them are many criminals.
p227_040|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p227_041|He looks like an Afghan.
p227_042|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
p227_043|I'd come back from London.
p227_044|If I was a woman.
p227_045|He was a home referee.
p227_046|There was no safety net.
p227_047|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p227_048|We have to look beyond the very short term.
p227_049|I expect a rapid response.
p227_050|That is very hard, alone.
p227_051|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p227_052|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p227_053|Four other charges were dropped.
p227_054|I could not do it.
p227_055|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p227_056|How are you, sir ?
p227_057|So is that it, then ?
p227_058|Do I have a favourite ?
p227_059|What do we do ?
p227_060|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p227_061|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p227_062|They have to come up with a solution.
p227_063|We will pay their bills.
p227_064|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p227_065|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p227_066|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p227_067|I have proved that in the past.
p227_068|He had been a singer.
p227_069|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p227_070|Then followed a bout of flu.
p227_071|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p227_072|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p227_073|It is a terrible place.
p227_074|Even the one she loved.
p227_075|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p227_076|There may be reasons for it.
p227_077|I first met him last summer.
p227_078|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p227_079|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p227_080|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p227_081|By then, he was walking on water.
p227_082|We have to offer value for money.
p227_083|They lived for their children.
p227_084|Potions said he would drive.
p227_085|The latter is due to be finished in February.
p227_086|This is a complex and detailed report.
p227_087|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p227_088|We will deal with the refugees.
p227_089|You might not make it.
p227_090|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p227_091|That is the important thing.
p227_092|For once, you should believe the hype.
p227_093|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p227_094|Their attitude is all wrong.
p227_095|You are like an animal.
p227_096|No, the equipment is extra.
p227_097|The following are the principal provisions.
p227_098|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p227_099|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p227_100|I had a fortunate war.
p227_101|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p227_102|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p227_103|It was never a starter.
p227_104|And the match was not too bad, either.
p227_105|Such actions are rarely popular.
p227_106|It is safe in our hands.
p227_107|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p227_108|It is much as it has been described.
p227_109|You can spend money on housing.
p227_110|That admission is not surprising.
p227_111|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p227_112|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p227_113|However, we have to be cautious.
p227_114|But we could only help a handful of people.
p227_116|It is just a tax on employment.
p227_117|This should begin in October.
p227_118|My life has changed a lot.
p227_119|We did what we had to do.
p227_120|Why do it otherwise ?
p227_121|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p227_122|So, did she meet him ?
p227_123|So what is the campaign about ?
p227_124|And does it ?
p227_125|You've got to be vigilant.
p227_126|We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
p227_127|Any success would have been an improvement.
p227_128|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p227_129|And I have some advice for my old friend.
p227_130|He is a great addition to our team.
p227_131|However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.
p227_132|I felt he was excellent.
p227_133|They could use a boost.
p227_134|It is a vicious circle.
p227_135|We could easily have lost that game.
p227_136|This is a limited market.
p227_137|Our position is quite simple.
p227_138|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p227_139|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p227_140|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
p227_141|He's not a Celtic man.
p227_142|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p227_143|So I got a blood test.
p227_144|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p227_145|These men are a part of India.
p227_146|Like the others, he was arrested.
p227_147|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p227_148|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p227_149|That was the difference between the sides.
p227_150|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p227_151|I was shaking on the blocks.
p227_152|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p227_153|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p227_154|The strong pound also took its toll.
p227_155|It was a funny feeling.
p227_156|I'd love to be like Peter.
p227_157|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p227_158|It is difficult to say.
p227_159|He was in great spirits.
p227_160|Seven people were later detained by police.
p227_161|They want to see him.
p227_162|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p227_163|Nobody did in those days.
p227_164|There is no signature on this document.
p227_165|We've made a couple of albums.
p227_166|What happened in that game ?
p227_167|Are you going to win ?
p227_168|Was it the wife ?
p227_169|Why change it ?
p227_170|What do we want to do that for ?
p227_171|The people are the hero.
p227_172|One season, they might do well.
p227_173|They made such decisions in London.
p227_174|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p227_175|The jury is still out.
p227_176|But he has a lifeline.
p227_177|The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
p227_178|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p227_179|It makes no influence on the public.
p227_180|That will apply to both sets of fans.
p227_181|I think it's a good sign.
p227_183|I have spoken to head office.
p227_184|Well, you can have a tree.
p227_186|They bought the property four years ago.
p227_187|He is believed to live in Britain.
p227_188|We've just had it confirmed.
p227_189|A copy of the report will be sent to them.
p227_190|This is the time to use it.
p227_191|You know the sort of thing.
p227_192|They were seriously after him.
p227_193|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p227_194|Trading conditions have not been that bad.
p227_195|I'm interested in interesting work.
p227_196|It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.
p227_197|The force is with them.
p227_198|If the director is with you.
p227_199|He made no order on costs.
p227_200|I guess I was lucky, though.
p227_201|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p227_203|It was served by sheriff officers.
p227_204|This will be our new beginning.
p227_205|They have the cash and the fire power.
p227_206|My heart is with the artist.
p227_207|That might mean another delay.
p227_208|However, it is not as simple as this.
p227_209|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p227_210|This is a holy place.
p227_211|Does the name matter ?
p227_212|how do you get it back ?
p227_213|What are you not good at ?
p227_214|I think, therefore I am ?
p227_215|Who was she ?
p227_216|You have caught a serial killer.
p227_217|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p227_218|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p227_219|They make a selective perception process.
p227_220|There is no quick fix.
p227_222|They have known the hard times.
p227_223|That might help a bit.
p227_226|I'm just a regular person.
p227_227|My daughter is an adult.
p227_228|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p227_229|It's just a normal life.
p227_230|He must get to know himself.
p227_231|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p227_232|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p227_233|The fight is under way.
p227_235|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p227_236|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p227_237|We can certainly build on this.
p227_238|William Hague delighted his party.
p227_239|There is a world of difference.
p227_240|We played them off the pitch.
p227_241|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p227_242|I can't wait to meet him.
p227_243|My wife and family are the support system.
p227_244|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p227_245|It is the voice of the survivors.
p227_246|She died in middle age.
p227_247|It is set in Paris.
p227_248|You will have seen the adverts.
p227_249|It is possible to be too good.
p227_250|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
p227_251|They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
p227_252|The irony was not lost.
p227_253|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p227_254|It is a court case.
p227_255|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p227_256|She took them for a term.
p227_257|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p227_258|Nato was not a love affair.
p227_259|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p227_260|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p227_261|You can feel at home in China.
p227_262|Our decision making was poor.
p227_263|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
p227_264|The baby deserves the credit.
p227_265|And they were being paid ?
p227_266|Was everything done to save people ?
p227_267|What was the matter for concern ?
p227_268|Do I think about them often ?
p227_269|Is it in the right place ?
p227_270|Did he trip ?
p227_271|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p227_272|I should think so, too.
p227_273|No production contract is yet in sight.
p227_274|The capital costs are modest.
p227_275|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p227_276|I told you I was ill.
p227_277|I can't get a job.
p227_278|That could be in place by next year.
p227_279|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p227_280|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p227_281|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p227_282|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p227_283|Every one is a winner.
p227_284|There's not much money in cycling.
p227_285|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p227_286|Not many companies can say that these days.
p227_287|They can leave at any time.
p227_288|You get a lot for your money.
p227_289|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
p227_290|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p227_291|It was an easy decision to come here.
p227_292|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p227_293|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p227_294|But the plot is not the point.
p227_295|It was never a free kick.
p227_296|My body is a wreck.
p227_297|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
p227_298|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p227_299|She failed in her action.
p227_300|Stephen will get his first cap.
p227_301|It's hard to see it.
p227_302|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
p227_303|We have to be very, very careful.
p227_304|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p227_305|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p227_306|It is an amazing response.
p227_307|Size is not the issue.
p227_308|He will address the nation this evening.
p227_309|We have the easy part.
p227_310|We are not increasing the number.
p227_311|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
p227_312|They do not reflect the quality of the brand.
p227_313|It could well be military.
p227_314|And that culture is everywhere in Dublin.
p227_315|His job was not advertised.
p227_316|This is a big step up.
p227_317|It goes back a long way.
p227_318|The weather forecast isn't good.
p227_319|We have a clean bill of health.
p227_320|In that case, the children were not missing.
p227_321|I have got a victim.
p227_322|The judge was really nice.
p227_323|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p227_324|McNaughton was not so sure.
p227_326|The dealer is on notice.
p227_327|It is hoped to complete the merger in the summer.
p227_328|The party lasted all night.
p227_329|He would help me with the form.
p227_330|There's still a bit to go.
p227_331|I'm not worried about the critics.
p227_332|I would do away with the dress code.
p227_333|It is so easy to be negative.
p227_334|What form did that take ?
p227_335|Are they free ?
p227_336|What are they for ?
p227_337|Is there a waiting list ?
p227_338|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p227_339|So what happens next ?
p227_340|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p227_341|I am not obsessed with sex.
p227_342|Have a look at this lot.
p227_343|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p227_344|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p227_345|The king is delighted by the honour.
p227_347|I've got a sense of humour, too.
p227_348|In the old days, it was easy.
p227_349|I came into this world with nothing.
p227_350|This is a trend which will be encouraged.
p227_351|There will have to be a full inquiry.
p227_352|There was no time scale.
p227_353|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p227_354|Whether this return was too soon.
p227_355|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
p227_356|They were the acts of men.
p227_357|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p227_358|Of course, we want to go home.
p227_359|I am very interested in the subject.
p227_360|He is not very big, either.
p227_361|A report is expected next month.
p227_363|We are encouraged by the news.
p227_364|Had this been common practice ?
p227_365|What do they want us to do ?
p227_366|Is it worth it ?
p227_367|Does it matter ?
p227_368|A crucial moment has arrived.
p227_369|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p227_370|We need to be prepared.
p227_371|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
p227_372|His views are hardly surprising.
p227_373|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p227_374|It has been made to entertain.
p227_375|It is a stroke of genius.
p227_376|Italy was just behind the US.
p227_377|It was forced to divert.
p227_378|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p227_379|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p227_380|We are still getting over it.
p227_382|This will impact on us.
p228_001|Please call Stella.
p228_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p228_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p228_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p228_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p228_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p228_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p228_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p228_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p228_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p228_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p228_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p228_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p228_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p228_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p228_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p228_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p228_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p228_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p228_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p228_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p228_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p228_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p228_025|It's nice to hear.
p228_026|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p228_027|Because we do not need it.
p228_028|There's a story, too.
p228_029|I feel I did not have enough time.
p228_030|Life was like a timetable.
p228_031|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p228_032|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p228_033|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p228_034|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p228_035|It was clear.
p228_036|The problem is the pitch.
p228_037|Indeed, he does.
p228_038|President Bush is at war.
p228_039|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p228_040|My whole life has changed.
p228_041|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p228_042|No meaningful response was issued.
p228_043|It is urgent.
p228_044|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p228_045|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p228_046|We need to chat.
p228_047|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p228_048|The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures.
p228_049|But it might have done.
p228_050|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p228_051|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p228_052|He looks like an Afghan.
p228_053|Here's a clue.
p228_054|It had been in place since last July.
p228_055|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p228_056|That's the day job.
p228_057|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p228_058|That's the truth.
p228_059|That is very hard, alone.
p228_060|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
p228_061|Four other charges were dropped.
p228_062|They're appalled by that.
p228_063|There was a battle there.
p228_064|Scotland had great assets.
p228_065|It's that kind of place.
p228_066|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p228_067|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p228_068|And if he hadn't become a musician ?
p228_069|He is a young man with a new deal.
p228_070|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p228_071|The script was funny.
p228_072|Try to save us.
p228_073|Sounds like The Sixth Sense ?
p228_074|Painful, but only because it's true.
p228_075|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p228_076|It's all I can do.
p228_077|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p228_078|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p228_079|I had my suspicions.
p228_081|People must remain vigilant.
p228_082|Today she has been released.
p228_083|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p228_084|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p228_085|But she might be.
p228_086|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p228_087|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p228_088|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p228_089|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p228_090|Now the system is right behind us.
p228_091|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p228_092|Today I couldn't run on it.
p228_093|However, it did not end that way.
p228_094|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p228_095|Safety was also an issue.
p228_096|It is an old family habit.
p228_097|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p228_098|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p228_099|It is annoying.
p228_100|We could not get any possession.
p228_101|I love the Dome.
p228_102|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p228_103|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p228_104|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p228_105|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p228_106|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p228_107|It is a good day for the coalition.
p228_108|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p228_109|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p228_110|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p228_111|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p228_112|We have an election in eight days.
p228_113|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p228_114|They will want to perform well.
p228_115|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p228_116|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p228_117|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p228_118|Further protests are likely.
p228_119|It's in his blood.
p228_120|I don't want to use the term.
p228_121|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p228_122|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p228_123|It is so sad.
p228_124|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p228_125|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p228_126|Who would be a referee ?
p228_127|They've got to account for it.
p228_128|It is a delight on every level.
p228_129|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p228_130|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p228_131|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p228_132|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p228_133|This plan is an agenda for action.
p228_134|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p228_135|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p228_136|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p228_137|Who will attend ?
p228_138|We had a reunion last week.
p228_139|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p228_140|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p228_141|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p228_142|He was in a great deal of pain.
p228_143|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p228_144|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p228_145|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p228_146|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p228_147|Who would be right ?
p228_148|It is difficult for Ali.
p228_149|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p228_150|Had she enjoyed the experience ?
p228_151|That should do it.
p228_152|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p228_153|It is not just about pay.
p228_154|I am just trying to do my job.
p228_155|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p228_156|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p228_157|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p228_158|The weather forecast isn't good.
p228_159|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p228_160|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p228_161|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p228_162|It was by the numbers.
p228_163|I was in daily contact.
p228_164|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p228_165|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p228_166|It was so new, so exciting.
p228_167|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p228_168|I've put my own money into this project.
p228_169|Eight months later, he was dead.
p228_170|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p228_171|We have to move forward.
p228_172|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p228_173|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p228_174|The post will be unpaid.
p228_175|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p228_176|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p228_177|We've made a couple of albums.
p228_178|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p228_179|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p228_180|One season, they might do well.
p228_181|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p228_182|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p228_183|The hotel was now for sale.
p228_184|I drove the ball well.
p228_185|I took the gun.
p228_186|We knew nothing about it.
p228_187|They will run a mile.
p228_188|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p228_189|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
p228_190|Miller was every bit as happy.
p228_191|I put the drawing down.
p228_192|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p228_193|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p228_194|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p228_195|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p228_196|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p228_197|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p228_198|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p228_199|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p228_200|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p228_202|It's the same old story.
p228_203|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p228_204|Is that success ?
p228_205|I have a cold.
p228_206|They are in the euro.
p228_207|Ferguson should take note.
p228_208|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p228_209|Who will pay for this ?
p228_210|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p228_211|He had suffered a heart attack.
p228_212|A deadline is still essential.
p228_213|Yet she is still the woman behind the famous man.
p228_214|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p228_215|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p228_216|That will be vital.
p228_217|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p228_218|That is an important part of our role.
p228_219|She should not be blamed.
p228_220|I had decided to quit the show.
p228_221|His third goal was superb.
p228_222|It's been a good year.
p228_223|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p228_224|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p228_225|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p228_226|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p228_227|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p228_228|It is a gamble.
p228_229|It's so special.
p228_230|You take a risk.
p228_231|He is severe.
p228_232|We just had a go.
p228_233|We are in the hat.
p228_234|We were a load of rubbish.
p228_235|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p228_236|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p228_237|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p228_238|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p228_239|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
p228_240|She was well balanced.
p228_241|It's only fair.
p228_242|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p228_243|You can feel at home in China.
p228_244|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p228_245|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p228_246|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p228_247|He's a lovely young man.
p228_248|It was a hit.
p228_249|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p228_250|I can't get a job.
p228_251|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p228_252|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p228_253|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p228_254|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p228_255|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p228_256|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p228_257|Is that a serious question ?
p228_258|They are real.
p228_259|They must play for each other.
p228_260|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
p228_261|His contract was then not renewed.
p228_262|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p228_263|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p228_264|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p228_265|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p228_266|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p228_267|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p228_268|I was rubbish.
p228_269|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p228_270|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p228_271|It's a way of life.
p228_272|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p228_274|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p228_275|They were too hard.
p228_276|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p228_277|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p228_278|All options are open.
p228_279|He will address the nation this evening.
p228_280|We want to see the maximum of change.
p228_281|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p228_282|He was obviously very genuine.
p228_283|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p228_284|It changed my life.
p228_285|The songs are just so good.
p228_286|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p228_287|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p228_288|It became a book by itself.
p228_289|The home was now under new management.
p228_290|Graeme was prepared.
p228_291|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p228_292|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p228_293|Our task is to complete the picture.
p228_294|They are wrong.
p228_295|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p228_296|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p228_297|You are the glory.
p228_298|It's certainly different.
p228_299|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p228_300|We want to play at the worlds.
p228_301|We have waited a long time for this.
p228_302|Is there on his hands ?
p228_303|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
p228_304|It's not even finished.
p228_305|We are a peaceful people.
p228_306|Kids are terrible.
p228_307|The problems began a long time ago.
p228_308|This film will be totally awesome.
p228_309|He said she was mad.
p228_310|There was some merit in that.
p228_311|I am very happy to be here.
p228_312|We do the same.
p228_313|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p228_315|It's not long enough.
p228_316|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p228_317|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p228_318|He was then replaced by Ross.
p228_319|Is that an issue ?
p228_320|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
p228_321|Robert is a special talent.
p228_322|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p228_323|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p228_324|There was no option.
p228_325|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p228_326|It is a sign of hope.
p228_327|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p228_328|It has moved on in the last week.
p228_329|The train was on time.
p228_330|It is so unfair.
p228_331|He has to learn.
p228_332|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p228_333|I've got no secret.
p228_334|Tiger is the exception.
p228_335|A great deal has been achieved.
p228_336|It was forced to divert.
p228_337|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p228_338|This is a friendly match ?
p228_339|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p228_340|He's a genius.
p228_341|They should take their mobile phones.
p228_342|It is not like working for a living.
p228_343|It's the last thing on my mind.
p228_344|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p228_345|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p228_346|That is a break with tradition.
p228_347|She is free.
p228_348|Everyone was in tears.
p228_349|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p228_350|As, indeed, they would be.
p228_351|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p229_001|Please call Stella.
p229_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p229_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p229_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p229_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p229_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p229_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p229_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p229_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p229_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p229_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p229_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p229_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p229_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p229_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p229_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p229_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p229_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p229_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p229_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p229_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p229_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p229_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p229_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p229_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p229_026|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p229_027|It's nice to hear.
p229_028|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p229_029|I have a theory.
p229_030|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
p229_031|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p229_032|Because we do not need it.
p229_033|And we have a singer.
p229_034|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p229_035|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p229_036|I'd like to continue that record.
p229_037|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p229_038|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p229_039|They're just different.
p229_040|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p229_041|It is not for any other purpose.
p229_042|He did not know his daughter.
p229_043|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p229_044|I was scared.
p229_045|It will come all right.
p229_046|But it took a lot of bottle.
p229_047|But it is all by design.
p229_048|I am just going to go for it.
p229_050|We need to chat.
p229_051|It is difficult for Ali.
p229_052|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p229_053|A recording contract is on the horizon.
p229_054|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p229_055|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p229_056|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p229_057|She's a spy !
p229_058|What was the main difference ?
p229_059|My mother is a widow.
p229_060|And a film maker was born.
p229_061|Art is extra.
p229_062|Scotland had great assets.
p229_063|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p229_064|We should have known.
p229_065|It is like a river running by my home.
p229_066|Try to save us.
p229_067|That was the easy election.
p229_068|I was as strong as a horse.
p229_069|Ferguson should take note.
p229_070|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p229_071|Neither it is.
p229_072|She died in hospital two hours later.
p229_073|It was chaotic.
p229_074|It is a job creation scheme.
p229_075|It works for us.
p229_076|I've not thought about it.
p229_077|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p229_078|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p229_079|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p229_080|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p229_081|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p229_082|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p229_083|Someone who cares
p229_084|He can do everything.
p229_085|By then, he was walking on water.
p229_086|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p229_087|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p229_088|They lived for their children.
p229_089|It is a lifeline.
p229_090|However, it did not end that way.
p229_091|We must look forward.
p229_092|It is an old family habit.
p229_093|Well, the big day has arrived.
p229_094|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p229_095|Until you hit the big games.
p229_096|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p229_097|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p229_098|She's got to say something.
p229_099|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p229_100|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p229_101|She has so much to offer.
p229_102|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
p229_103|It is a good day for the coalition.
p229_104|We work on the same level.
p229_105|They were outside the circle.
p229_106|Two of the team became ill.
p229_108|I didn't play well last year.
p229_109|Before the game we went for a pint.
p229_110|I'm not depressed.
p229_111|It is normal.
p229_112|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p229_113|I don't have many friends.
p229_114|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p229_115|I came to complete.
p229_116|I was angry.
p229_117|They were behind the wheel.
p229_118|The fire was above the hole.
p229_119|It's not fair.
p229_120|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p229_121|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p229_122|Maybe this battle has been.
p229_123|I'm delighted about that.
p229_124|I joined a group.
p229_125|It is rubbish.
p229_126|Who would be a referee ?
p229_127|It was my own fault and I lost a lot of belief.
p229_128|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p229_129|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p229_130|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p229_131|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p229_132|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p229_133|She really suffered for her art.
p229_134|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p229_135|It's an amazing landscape !
p229_136|So the European elections are extremely important.
p229_137|He is slightly confused.
p229_138|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p229_139|If not, a deal could take many months.
p229_140|They took a risk.
p229_141|Government will intervene.
p229_142|What will happen then ?
p229_143|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p229_144|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p229_145|This represents a tough game for us.
p229_146|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p229_147|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p229_148|Three penalties were given.
p229_149|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p229_150|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p229_151|Who would be right ?
p229_152|We just had a go.
p229_153|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p229_154|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p229_155|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p229_156|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p229_157|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p229_158|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p229_159|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p229_160|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p229_161|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p229_162|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p229_163|It was by the numbers.
p229_164|I knew he was good.
p229_165|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p229_166|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p229_167|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p229_168|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p229_169|Was this element always there ?
p229_170|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p229_171|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
p229_172|I will tell you.
p229_173|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p229_174|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p229_175|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p229_176|We have to move forward.
p229_177|It's that sort of night.
p229_178|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p229_179|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p229_180|The post will be unpaid.
p229_181|Does that put pressure on us ?
p229_182|It is a memorial.
p229_183|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p229_184|They thought they had found a home.
p229_185|One season, they might do well.
p229_186|Is Saddam a threat ?
p229_187|The home was now under new management.
p229_188|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p229_189|The hotel was now for sale.
p229_190|I drove the ball well.
p229_191|It is the whole package.
p229_192|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p229_193|We knew nothing about it.
p229_194|It is minute.
p229_195|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p229_196|Four policemen were wounded.
p229_197|What has caused the demise of singing ?
p229_198|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p229_199|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p229_200|I've got good news and bad news for you.
p229_201|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p229_202|People will ask about us.
p229_203|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p229_204|Last night was a key episode.
p229_205|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p229_206|It wasn't to be.
p229_207|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p229_209|I came home by ambulance.
p229_210|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p229_211|It's the same old story.
p229_212|But we are not immune to the problem.
p229_213|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p229_214|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p229_215|The procedures were not in place.
p229_216|It was worth a photograph.
p229_217|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p229_218|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p229_219|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p229_220|That is an important part of our role.
p229_221|She should not be blamed.
p229_222|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p229_223|I am delighted for Simon.
p229_224|I had decided to quit the show.
p229_225|The FBI could become involved.
p229_226|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p229_227|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p229_228|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p229_229|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p229_230|Who was on the panel ?
p229_231|We've got the bronze.
p229_232|Saturday is gone.
p229_233|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p229_234|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p229_235|The boy is no longer with us.
p229_236|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p229_237|The track is currently covered in snow.
p229_238|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p229_239|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p229_240|We are so proud.
p229_241|We were a load of rubbish.
p229_242|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p229_243|It's an idea.
p229_244|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p229_245|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p229_246|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p229_247|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p229_248|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p229_249|The letters are going out today.
p229_250|It's only fair.
p229_251|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p229_252|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p229_253|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p229_254|It was a hit.
p229_255|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p229_256|This year I understood.
p229_257|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p229_258|Kirkwood was arrested.
p229_259|This is a big club.
p229_260|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p229_261|I was happily surprised.
p229_262|They must play for each other.
p229_263|The pensioners did not want to know.
p229_264|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p229_265|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p229_266|That is highly unfair.
p229_267|The warning is timely.
p229_268|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p229_269|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p229_270|They are never here.
p229_271|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p229_272|He was also married with two children.
p229_273|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p229_274|We're in shock.
p229_275|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p229_277|It's a way of life.
p229_278|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p229_279|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p229_280|I am an estate agent.
p229_281|People have no choice.
p229_282|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p229_283|It was a privilege to work for him.
p229_284|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p229_285|If not, he should go home.
p229_286|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p229_287|I saw it at a ruck.
p229_288|I felt like I was a child.
p229_289|What would be the timetable for withdrawal ?
p229_290|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p229_292|We have other options.
p229_293|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p229_294|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p229_295|These figures are truly awful.
p229_296|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p229_297|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p229_298|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p229_300|I was brought up in a mining background.
p229_301|I thought it was my only chance.
p229_302|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p229_303|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p229_304|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p229_305|There is no openness.
p229_306|This is a war over our home.
p229_307|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p229_308|It's just not funny !
p229_309|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p229_310|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p229_311|You are the glory.
p229_312|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p229_313|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p229_314|It's certainly different.
p229_315|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p229_316|This is the culture change in medicine.
p229_318|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p229_319|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p229_320|It's not even finished.
p229_322|It should be equal.
p229_323|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
p229_324|We are very strongly behind the bid.
p229_325|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p229_326|I am very happy to be here.
p229_328|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p229_329|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p229_330|It could have gone either way.
p229_331|He was then replaced by Ross.
p229_332|I'd like to take the plunge.
p229_333|She did not attend the courtroom.
p229_334|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p229_335|He told the court.
p229_336|The team for the first game could be this one.
p229_337|They haven't got a hope.
p229_338|It has moved on in the last week.
p229_339|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p229_340|He did a good job.
p229_341|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p229_342|Today she has been released.
p229_343|These days are long gone.
p229_344|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p229_345|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p229_346|Indeed, it was magical.
p229_347|I've got no secret.
p229_348|Look at the witnesses.
p229_349|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p229_350|I'm very lucky.
p229_351|They may yet have the last laugh.
p229_352|Everything was an effort.
p229_353|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p229_354|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p229_355|It is long gone.
p229_356|It's the last thing on my mind.
p229_357|Tell us about it.
p229_358|There is a cup final at stake.
p229_359|That is a break with tradition.
p229_360|It was very formal.
p229_361|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p229_362|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p229_363|It benefits the whole family.
p229_364|It was fit for royalty.
p229_365|We are looking for perfection.
p229_366|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p229_367|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p229_368|I am a star.
p230_001|Please call Stella.
p230_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p230_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p230_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p230_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p230_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p230_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p230_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p230_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p230_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p230_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p230_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p230_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p230_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p230_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p230_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p230_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p230_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p230_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p230_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p230_025|It is on the internet.
p230_026|Smoking is also very important.
p230_027|He has the courage of the unaware.
p230_028|Life was like a timetable.
p230_029|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p230_030|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p230_031|I'm so happy that she did.
p230_032|The wedding was in Edinburgh.
p230_033|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p230_034|He really is a lovely man.
p230_035|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p230_036|This represents a tough game for us.
p230_037|The boy is no longer with us.
p230_038|They said she was stable.
p230_039|This will save interest charges.
p230_040|Well, he is an artist.
p230_041|He looks like an Afghan.
p230_042|People want to see me on the screen.
p230_043|The big problem is the lack of grass.
p230_044|That was the theory, anyway.
p230_045|I was inspired by two things.
p230_046|If not, he should go home.
p230_047|I must take a seat.
p230_048|It was bound to happen.
p230_049|We have to bring in new players.
p230_050|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p230_051|I have made that offer.
p230_052|None has ever been found.
p230_053|Four other charges were dropped.
p230_054|We should be able to cope.
p230_055|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p230_056|We will pay their bills.
p230_057|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
p230_058|It was exactly four months away.
p230_059|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p230_060|It's not covered by the insurance.
p230_061|But the challenge is in the US.
p230_062|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p230_063|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p230_064|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p230_065|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p230_066|He also received a medal of honour.
p230_068|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
p230_069|It is a job creation scheme.
p230_070|It looks like a hit.
p230_071|What do we do ?
p230_072|Why do it otherwise ?
p230_073|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p230_074|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p230_075|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p230_076|Consumer confidence remains an issue.
p230_077|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p230_078|This is a true story.
p230_079|By then, he was walking on water.
p230_080|It's so hard to shift.
p230_081|They lived for their children.
p230_083|It might change your life.
p230_084|You are a great player.
p230_085|However, it did not end that way.
p230_086|We will deal with the refugees.
p230_087|It was not an insult.
p230_088|You might not make it.
p230_089|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p230_090|I did not have a bet on myself.
p230_091|The conclusion is the same.
p230_092|He was prepared for this.
p230_093|But I know the course.
p230_094|You are like an animal.
p230_095|We intend to change the model.
p230_096|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p230_097|Two of the team became ill.
p230_099|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
p230_100|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p230_101|Before the game we went for a pint.
p230_102|This was a good move for me.
p230_103|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p230_104|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
p230_105|It is close to call.
p230_106|It is an impressive record.
p230_107|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p230_108|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p230_109|Abbey National is an option.
p230_110|The arrival of the Scottish Premier League has also presented a problem.
p230_112|We have the mental strength.
p230_113|You can spend money on housing.
p230_114|That admission is not surprising.
p230_115|I can't even get into the A team.
p230_116|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p230_117|Which can happen any time.
p230_118|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p230_119|But this time we can have no excuses.
p230_120|They are very happy with the new settlement.
p230_121|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p230_122|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
p230_123|We did what we had to do.
p230_124|She was also very brave.
p230_125|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p230_126|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p230_127|The opposite is the case.
p230_128|He was a home referee.
p230_129|This is a successful outcome.
p230_130|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p230_131|She died at her home.
p230_132|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p230_133|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p230_134|It was a piece of art.
p230_135|I would relish the prospect.
p230_137|These men are a part of India.
p230_138|I was caught out a little bit.
p230_139|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p230_140|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p230_141|It has to be an event.
p230_142|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p230_143|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p230_144|The first thing is to assess the damage that has been done.
p230_145|She has gone to the Catholic school.
p230_146|It was by the numbers.
p230_147|I am not going to make any further comment, apart from that.
p230_148|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p230_149|However, he was later released without charge.
p230_150|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p230_151|These days are long gone.
p230_152|I'm afraid to say anything.
p230_153|We are still getting over it.
p230_154|It has to be now.
p230_155|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p230_156|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p230_157|They will do their own thing.
p230_158|You had to go and see him.
p230_159|So what is the campaign about ?
p230_160|And does it ?
p230_161|Are you from the rugby ?
p230_162|Had I heard ?
p230_163|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p230_164|Our position remains the same.
p230_165|Nobody did in those days.
p230_166|We believe in the medium term.
p230_167|It's nice to be nice.
p230_168|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
p230_169|On the month the weakness was across the board.
p230_170|One season, they might do well.
p230_171|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
p230_172|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p230_173|But he has a lifeline.
p230_174|Phase one was a shambles.
p230_175|City sentiment is in his favour.
p230_176|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p230_177|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p230_178|Tomorrow is a new day.
p230_179|It makes no influence on the public.
p230_180|She has left the island.
p230_181|He played it like a veteran.
p230_182|I have spoken to head office.
p230_183|They will run a mile.
p230_184|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p230_185|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p230_186|He prefers to play for them.
p230_188|He lives in a neighbouring village.
p230_189|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p230_190|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p230_191|We represent a wide range of society.
p230_192|We always felt we could win.
p230_194|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p230_195|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
p230_196|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p230_198|I made a terrible start.
p230_199|The result is called a patent.
p230_200|We played them off the pitch.
p230_201|Racism has no place in any sport.
p230_202|Tommy is not a problem.
p230_203|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p230_204|This is a holy place.
p230_205|He had suffered a heart attack.
p230_206|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p230_207|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p230_208|This will take several weeks.
p230_209|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p230_210|We have an election in eight days.
p230_211|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p230_212|There is no quick fix.
p230_213|All will be revealed in due course.
p230_214|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p230_215|The most exciting room is the final one of the show.
p230_216|He has made his base in Spain.
p230_217|My life is in the ballet.
p230_218|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p230_219|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p230_220|His second was a beauty.
p230_221|What do we want to do that for ?
p230_222|Does the name matter ?
p230_223|How do you get it back ?
p230_224|What are you not good at ?
p230_225|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p230_226|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p230_227|It was a day for records.
p230_228|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p230_230|That has been the easy part.
p230_231|Things were so intense in the studio.
p230_232|I was not sure whether I had won.
p230_233|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p230_234|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p230_235|It is the voice of the survivors.
p230_236|It had so much to do with output.
p230_237|Must have been at the bar.
p230_238|She died in middle age.
p230_239|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p230_240|They need to win a trophy.
p230_241|Half the young people had had contact with the police.
p230_242|It is possible to be too good.
p230_243|In many ways, that is as important.
p230_244|Here is a question for you.
p230_245|I was just a kid.
p230_246|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p230_247|Hospitals are for the ill.
p230_248|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p230_249|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p230_250|We have to compete at our own level.
p230_251|They showed a lot of heart.
p230_252|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p230_253|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p230_254|She took them for a term.
p230_255|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p230_257|Nato was not a love affair.
p230_258|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p230_259|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p230_260|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p230_261|You can feel at home in China.
p230_262|Persuaded to change his mind.
p230_263|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p230_264|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p230_265|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p230_266|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p230_267|I should think so, too.
p230_268|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p230_269|I've had no discussions with the chairman of the board.
p230_270|I was ready for this.
p230_271|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p230_272|They are interior designers and architects.
p230_273|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p230_274|We feel very good about it.
p230_276|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p230_277|It is also very valuable.
p230_278|None of this work is guaranteed.
p230_279|There is a case to answer.
p230_280|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p230_281|They can leave at any time.
p230_282|And they were being paid ?
p230_283|was everything done to save people ?
p230_284|What was the matter for concern ?
p230_285|Do I think about them often ?
p230_286|That was a gold medal for certain.
p230_287|You get a lot for your money.
p230_288|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p230_289|In that moment, I was happy.
p230_290|The actor has met with Mandela.
p230_291|It was never a free kick.
p230_292|It is a recipe for success.
p230_293|I would rather look at him.
p230_295|It's got to come from me.
p230_296|It took a month and a half to film.
p230_297|The cause of the accident remained unclear.
p230_298|It is a symbolic concert.
p230_299|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p230_300|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p230_302|He is at war with his knee.
p230_303|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p230_304|I was there five months ago.
p230_305|You have to see it like this.
p230_306|Rugby is now just like football.
p230_307|It could well be military.
p230_308|His job was not advertised.
p230_309|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p230_310|We have a clean bill of health.
p230_311|And we can do it.
p230_312|The songs are just so good.
p230_313|The casting is as perfect.
p230_314|I can hardly believe it.
p230_315|I must do something about it.
p230_316|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p230_317|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p230_318|They are not left wing.
p230_319|McNaughton was not so sure.
p230_321|It is a road of death.
p230_322|The party lasted all night.
p230_323|The group is not paying a dividend.
p230_324|We were on our way.
p230_325|I was as strong as a horse.
p230_326|That meant the search was unlawful.
p230_327|We have a good healthy debate.
p230_328|I would do away with the dress code.
p230_329|We are on a four-year mission.
p230_330|This is a historic occasion.
p230_331|This ruling is a farce.
p230_332|I can see their argument.
p230_333|After some discussion they did.
p230_334|It was always an option.
p230_335|Does that put pressure on us ?
p230_336|Did it work ?
p230_337|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p230_338|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p230_339|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p230_340|You may have a short memory.
p230_341|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p230_342|In the old days, it was easy.
p230_343|There was some merit in that.
p230_344|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p230_345|The airport was even different.
p230_346|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p230_347|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p230_348|There was no time scale.
p230_349|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p230_350|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p230_351|He is not very big, either.
p230_352|I have a moral dilemma.
p230_353|Even the one she loved.
p230_354|You have no chance of planning permission.
p230_355|We are encouraged by the news.
p230_356|In addition, certain areas closed at certain times.
p230_357|The professor said the results were positive.
p230_358|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p230_359|Three years ago he would have been.
p230_360|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
p230_361|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p230_362|I am a lucky man.
p230_363|Nobody else was with me.
p230_364|We put our bid in last night.
p230_365|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p230_366|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p230_367|But BA said the prediction was premature.
p230_368|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p230_369|They have broken the promise.
p230_370|We are really good friends.
p230_371|My goal is quite simple.
p230_372|This is a major championship.
p230_373|It's going to be fun.
p230_374|She is now on the back benches.
p230_375|Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited.
p230_376|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p230_377|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p230_378|We are a Scottish company.
p230_379|We will win the argument.
p230_380|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p230_381|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p230_382|I always knew she was funny.
p230_383|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p230_384|The marshall at the turn was great.
p230_385|If you can get it.
p230_386|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p230_387|There was a substantial explosion.
p230_388|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p230_389|He could face a jail sentence.
p230_390|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p230_391|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p230_392|Clark is back on top form.
p230_393|Motion described it as a unique event.
p230_394|I had a fortunate war.
p230_395|Are they free ?
p231_001|Please call Stella.
p231_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p231_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p231_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p231_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p231_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p231_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p231_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p231_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p231_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p231_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p231_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p231_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p231_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p231_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p231_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p231_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p231_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p231_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p231_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p231_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p231_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p231_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p231_025|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p231_026|I'd just like to play.
p231_027|Because we do not need it.
p231_028|There was a rush of water.
p231_029|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p231_030|That deal is a joke.
p231_031|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p231_032|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p231_033|It carried a double message.
p231_034|That means an extra two years.
p231_035|I became a widow overnight.
p231_036|But he can turn on the charm.
p231_037|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p231_038|The man became a reporter.
p231_039|Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen.
p231_040|Last year, I was pretty bad.
p231_041|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p231_042|Among them are many criminals.
p231_043|He looks like an Afghan.
p231_044|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p231_045|I guess I was lucky, though.
p231_046|I was inspired by two things.
p231_047|A win is a win.
p231_048|There was no safety net.
p231_049|There's nothing we could do about this.
p231_050|It is a symbolic concert.
p231_051|We keep an eye on it.
p231_052|We have not given up hope.
p231_053|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p231_054|She said she was really sorry.
p231_055|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p231_056|Italy is a beautiful place.
p231_057|Four other charges were dropped.
p231_058|We should be able to cope.
p231_059|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p231_061|So is that it, then ?
p231_062|Do I have a favourite ?
p231_063|What do we do ?
p231_064|It was a lovely experience.
p231_065|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p231_066|We will pay their bills.
p231_067|Only water is currently allowed.
p231_068|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p231_069|We need to increase the membership.
p231_070|This is an exciting new venture.
p231_071|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p231_072|Then followed a bout of flu.
p231_073|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p231_074|Both men were on one-year contracts.
p231_076|That would be too easy.
p231_078|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p231_079|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p231_080|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p231_081|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p231_082|It's so hard to shift.
p231_083|They lived for their children.
p231_085|However, it did not end that way.
p231_086|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
p231_087|It is an old family habit.
p231_088|He's been hit by it.
p231_089|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p231_090|I saw the whole thing.
p231_091|But I know the course.
p231_092|Their attitude is all wrong.
p231_093|We must stop it with the golf ball.
p231_094|You are like an animal.
p231_095|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p231_097|We should recognise others have done a good job.
p231_098|We live by the rule of law.
p231_099|Two of the team became ill.
p231_100|No, the equipment is extra.
p231_101|That time is not now, however.
p231_102|It's not a quick fix.
p231_103|Why do it otherwise ?
p231_104|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p231_105|So, did she meet him ?
p231_106|So what is the campaign about ?
p231_107|And does it ?
p231_108|Before the game we went for a pint.
p231_109|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p231_110|You'd better believe it.
p231_111|New Year will be very busy.
p231_112|There's still plenty time left.
p231_113|It proved a good decision.
p231_114|Maybe this battle has been.
p231_115|January is a bad time of year.
p231_116|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
p231_117|It is much as it has been described.
p231_118|Then again, we could have.
p231_119|It is a delight on every level.
p231_120|There were no grounds for his action.
p231_121|I was just a child.
p231_122|We should not be surprised.
p231_123|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
p231_124|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p231_125|That period was a struggle.
p231_126|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p231_127|This should begin in October.
p231_128|That is far too high.
p231_129|If not, a deal could take many months.
p231_130|It plans to return to this field.
p231_131|They made such decisions in London.
p231_132|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p231_133|It is a common problem.
p231_134|You're a gambling man.
p231_135|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p231_136|He is a great addition to our team.
p231_137|This is a successful outcome.
p231_138|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p231_139|Put yourself in the position of being a referee.
p231_140|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p231_141|I miss the freedom that I had.
p231_142|It only increased the support for him.
p231_143|Anyone can do the sums.
p231_144|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p231_145|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p231_146|It has become a way of life.
p231_147|The whole industry is a shambles.
p231_148|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p231_149|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p231_150|We have a clean bill of health.
p231_151|It is not normal practice.
p231_152|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p231_153|He was asked to quit.
p231_154|A new school will be built.
p231_155|The strong pound also took its toll.
p231_156|It is a terrible tragedy.
p231_157|He was right into football from an early age.
p231_158|It is not like us.
p231_159|What happened in that game ?
p231_160|Are you going to win ?
p231_161|Was it the wife ?
p231_162|Why change it ?
p231_163|What do we want to do that for ?
p231_164|He was in great spirits.
p231_165|We have a budget in March.
p231_166|You've been a great audience.
p231_167|It is simply not true.
p231_168|Well, this article is a bit like that.
p231_169|It is really good news.
p231_170|We've made a couple of albums.
p231_171|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
p231_172|My life has been destroyed.
p231_173|I always felt they played for me.
p231_174|One season, they might do well.
p231_175|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p231_176|This much I can tell you.
p231_177|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p231_178|We are the gateway to justice.
p231_179|But one was not enough.
p231_180|I have spoken to head office.
p231_181|I am not ready to walk away.
p231_183|The shooting created panic in the street.
p231_184|So many people will be affected by this.
p231_185|As many as the market will support.
p231_186|They need to look after themselves.
p231_188|This is the time to use it.
p231_189|You know the sort of thing.
p231_190|I'm interested in interesting work.
p231_191|We represent a wide range of society.
p231_192|People will ask about us.
p231_193|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p231_194|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
p231_195|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p231_196|I came home by ambulance.
p231_197|I suggest a new plan.
p231_198|It was a moment of madness.
p231_199|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p231_200|Libya is an easy target.
p231_201|Does the name matter ?
p231_202|how do you get it back ?
p231_203|What are you no good at ?
p231_205|Who was she ?
p231_206|It gave no further details.
p231_207|You've caught a serial killer.
p231_208|I won't make an official complaint.
p231_209|We are a new department.
p231_210|It was worth a photograph.
p231_211|They are looking at flotation.
p231_212|Which isn't a bad idea.
p231_213|We have an election in eight days.
p231_214|He also presented You Bet!
p231_215|That might help a bit.
p231_216|I had decided to quit the show.
p231_217|He has a lot of skill.
p231_218|I've wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p231_219|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p231_220|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p231_221|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p231_222|That you can do it.
p231_223|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p231_224|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p231_225|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p231_226|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p231_228|We played them off the pitch.
p231_229|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p231_230|They are the innocent victims.
p231_231|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p231_232|She died in middle age.
p231_233|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p231_234|It is set in Paris.
p231_235|The irony was not lost.
p231_236|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p231_237|Hospitals are for the ill.
p231_238|The minister is the engineer.
p231_239|My future is in the marathon.
p231_240|It is now the big brother.
p231_241|The parties have no contact.
p231_242|She took them for a term.
p231_243|Nato was not a love affair.
p231_244|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
p231_245|You can feel at home in China.
p231_246|His is a global perspective.
p231_247|Persuaded to change his mind.
p231_248|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p231_249|This ruling is a farce.
p231_250|The baby deserves the credit.
p231_251|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p231_252|But they were never expected to last.
p231_253|It was a cry for help.
p231_254|No production contract is yet in sight.
p231_255|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p231_256|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p231_257|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
p231_258|It seems a shame to leave it.
p231_259|It was the climax of the thing.
p231_260|The concerns are the same.
p231_261|I can't get a job.
p231_262|And they were being paid ?
p231_263|was everything done to save people ?
p231_264|What was the matter for concern ?
p231_265|Do I think about them often ?
p231_266|Is it in the right place ?
p231_267|Did he trip ?
p231_268|I've had the time of my life.
p231_269|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p231_270|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p231_271|I thought he might have been a bit.
p231_272|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p231_273|I'd never run for them.
p231_274|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p231_275|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p231_276|These figures are truly terrible.
p231_277|Share prices have fallen for three years in a row.
p231_278|The joint bid is still on course.
p231_279|At first I thought I was gone.
p231_280|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p231_281|They can leave at any time.
p231_282|That view has not altered.
p231_283|You get a lot for your money.
p231_284|Blair also had a penalty.
p231_285|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p231_286|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p231_288|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p231_289|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p231_290|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p231_291|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p231_292|I've lost all confidence.
p231_293|This could be a mistake.
p231_294|Once again, they would be wrong.
p231_295|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p231_296|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p231_297|He will address the nation this evening.
p231_298|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p231_299|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p231_300|But it is up again.
p231_301|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
p231_302|It could well be military.
p231_303|I was just so determined.
p231_304|That was the difference between the sides.
p231_305|The judge was really nice.
p231_307|You are a different people.
p231_308|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p231_309|He is still in shock.
p231_310|McNaughton was not so sure.
p231_312|I thought it was my only chance.
p231_313|I thought he did very well.
p231_314|I'm not making any comment at all.
p231_315|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p231_316|We're on our way.
p231_317|They come to enjoy themselves.
p231_318|That meant the search was unlawful.
p231_319|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p231_320|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p231_322|We want to play at the worlds.
p231_323|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p231_324|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p231_325|Have a look at this lot.
p231_326|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p231_327|The king is delighted by the honour.
p231_328|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p231_329|The problems began a long time ago.
p231_330|I am not sure about the rate of progress.
p231_331|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p231_332|In the old days, it was easy.
p231_333|However, the groups denied the claims.
p231_334|She is now on the back benches.
p231_336|I think it's about time.
p231_337|The airport was even different.
p231_338|There was no time scale.
p231_339|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p231_340|At first, the youngster was not keen.
p231_341|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p231_342|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p231_343|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p231_344|He was then replaced by Ross.
p231_345|Finally came the moment of truth.
p231_346|We are encouraged by the news.
p231_347|What form did that take ?
p231_348|Are they free ?
p231_349|What are they for ?
p231_350|Is there a waiting list ?
p231_351|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p231_352|So what happens next ?
p231_353|The units will not be replaced.
p231_354|Neither man has been charged.
p231_355|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p231_357|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p231_358|I am a lucky man.
p231_359|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p231_360|I've always been a sensitive.
p231_361|Glasgow is a friendly city.
p231_362|You did not see it.
p231_363|We live on an island.
p231_364|It is not real life.
p231_365|Neither woman has been named.
p231_366|They should take their mobile phones.
p231_367|You need a licence to run a pub.
p231_368|We regret that they're brought in the first place.
p231_369|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p231_370|This is a major championship.
p231_371|The result is called a patent.
p231_372|But we finished the show.
p231_373|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p231_374|There is no deal as yet.
p231_375|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p231_376|We were given a break.
p231_377|In due course the deal was done.
p231_378|to have products for their needs.
p231_379|The pair are very much in love.
p231_380|We will win the argument.
p231_381|Had this been common practice ?
p231_382|What do they want us to do ?
p231_383|Is it worth it ?
p231_384|Does it matter ?
p231_385|You have to rely on each other.
p231_386|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p231_387|I wanted to go out on a high.
p231_388|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p231_389|That time may never be broken.
p231_390|It was fit for royalty.
p231_391|The response from them was good.
p231_392|There was a substantial explosion.
p231_393|But we are very near.
p231_394|That's as good as it gets.
p231_395|A review is under way.
p231_396|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p231_397|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p231_398|They have failed to deliver.
p231_399|Clark is back on top form.
p231_400|I had a fortunate war.
p231_401|She is in their hands.
p231_402|It is a large number.
p231_403|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p231_404|It is hard to understand.
p231_405|It was a bank holiday, after all.
p231_406|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p231_407|There was an element of frustration.
p231_408|I should think so, too.
p231_409|How do you take them away ?
p231_411|After the match, do you ?
p231_412|I will always remember the horrible images.
p231_414|They are looking for profit.
p231_415|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p231_416|There is some light in the tunnel.
p231_417|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
p231_418|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p231_419|The case will now go to appeal.
p231_420|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p231_421|There is a solution, she believes.
p231_422|Yet the data is compelling.
p231_423|It was important to win the singles.
p231_424|The road was closed for several hours.
p231_426|My aim is a top six finish.
p231_427|I would love to think that she could win.
p231_428|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p231_429|He is on the wrong side.
p231_430|It was a breathtaking moment.
p231_431|I was in jail for five years.
p231_432|I never had a childhood.
p231_433|It is based on a true story.
p231_434|But it can be done.
p231_435|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p231_436|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
p231_437|The growth potential is enormous.
p231_438|They are not left wing.
p231_439|The British government does not want to know.
p231_440|They said they were only young men.
p231_441|We shall not forget him.
p231_442|The people are the hero.
p231_443|They made a huge impression on me.
p231_444|It's never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
p231_445|It sounded like a bomb.
p231_446|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p231_447|We've got a good management record.
p231_448|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
p231_449|And we might go back.
p231_450|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p231_451|We went straight into the bedroom.
p231_452|Its future is no longer in question.
p231_453|We put our bid in last night.
p231_454|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
p231_456|They have to be met.
p232_001|Please call Stella.
p232_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p232_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p232_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p232_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p232_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p232_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p232_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p232_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p232_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p232_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p232_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p232_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p232_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p232_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p232_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p232_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p232_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p232_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p232_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p232_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p232_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p232_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p232_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p232_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p232_026|But it failed.
p232_027|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p232_028|They should be so lucky.
p232_029|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p232_030|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p232_031|It's a matter of balance.
p232_032|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p232_033|I would love it.
p232_034|It is marvellous.
p232_035|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p232_036|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p232_037|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p232_038|It was fit for royalty.
p232_039|I was scared.
p232_040|Dancing was her life.
p232_041|I suspect the latter.
p232_042|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p232_043|But it took a lot of bottle.
p232_044|We will push.
p232_045|It is urgent.
p232_046|The judge said.
p232_047|It is difficult for Ali.
p232_048|But it might have done.
p232_049|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p232_050|They had to explain it.
p232_051|Here's a clue.
p232_052|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p232_053|It's the big omission.
p232_054|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p232_055|It's very odd.
p232_056|Because we do not need it.
p232_057|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p232_058|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p232_059|That's the truth.
p232_060|That is very hard, alone.
p232_061|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p232_062|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p232_063|You do not change overnight.
p232_064|People love to see this stuff.
p232_065|He was popular.
p232_066|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p232_067|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p232_068|It is like a river running by my home.
p232_069|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p232_070|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p232_071|Painful, but only because it's true.
p232_072|That was the easy election.
p232_073|There could be a way back.
p232_074|Then followed a bout of flu.
p232_075|The price cuts are really exciting.
p232_076|I had my suspicions.
p232_077|It was chaotic.
p232_078|It is a job creation scheme.
p232_079|He is now resident in England.
p232_080|I've got the shirt.
p232_081|Today she has been released.
p232_082|What has changed ?
p232_083|That is bound to happen.
p232_084|I will miss him.
p232_085|It's all going to clear the debt.
p232_086|She had kept the news from him.
p232_087|No progress has been made.
p232_088|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p232_089|Now the system is right behind us.
p232_090|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p232_091|It is a lifeline.
p232_092|Today I couldn't run on it.
p232_093|However, it did not end that way.
p232_094|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p232_095|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p232_096|Then came the crunch.
p232_097|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p232_098|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p232_099|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p232_100|It was mayhem.
p232_101|They were outside the circle.
p232_102|It was a good performance.
p232_103|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p232_104|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p232_105|That is no use.
p232_106|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p232_107|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p232_108|He pleaded for caution.
p232_109|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p232_110|I don't have many friends.
p232_111|He was jailed for a year.
p232_112|You had better believe it.
p232_113|It's not fair.
p232_114|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p232_115|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p232_116|Maybe this battle has been.
p232_117|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p232_118|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p232_119|This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.
p232_120|It is rubbish.
p232_121|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p232_122|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p232_123|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p232_124|That's all right then.
p232_125|I'm so angry.
p232_126|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p232_127|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p232_128|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p232_129|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p232_130|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p232_131|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p232_132|I am now unemployed.
p232_133|If not, a deal could take many months.
p232_134|You've got to be vigilant.
p232_135|Our intentions are real.
p232_136|They took a risk.
p232_137|The goals were good.
p232_138|What will happen then ?
p232_139|I am totally devoted to this job.
p232_140|He is severe.
p232_141|She died at her home.
p232_142|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
p232_143|They did very well.
p232_144|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p232_145|We want to see the maximum of change.
p232_146|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p232_147|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p232_148|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p232_149|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p232_150|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p232_151|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p232_152|It was by the numbers.
p232_153|I was in daily contact.
p232_154|They were later discharged from hospital.
p232_155|This latter point is hugely important.
p232_156|It is an attitude of mind.
p232_158|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p232_159|We have to move forward.
p232_160|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p232_161|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p232_162|Tell it like it was ?
p232_163|It is not too late to get on board.
p232_164|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p232_165|Again, we were lucky.
p232_166|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p232_167|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p232_168|That will do for me.
p232_169|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p232_170|We've made a couple of albums.
p232_171|My life has been destroyed.
p232_172|They thought they had found a home.
p232_173|It became a book by itself.
p232_174|I always felt they played for me.
p232_175|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p232_176|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p232_177|Blair's response was weak.
p232_178|It's the real thing, for sure.
p232_179|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p232_180|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p232_181|The clarity is vital.
p232_182|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p232_183|Everyone can be bought.
p232_184|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p232_185|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p232_186|It is the whole package.
p232_187|I've been there.
p232_188|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p232_189|They receive a high profile in the media.
p232_190|We did everything by the book.
p232_191|I wish I could say something.
p232_192|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p232_193|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p232_194|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p232_195|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p232_196|I came home by ambulance.
p232_197|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p232_198|The conference is the first test.
p232_199|The service from the other players was super.
p232_200|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
p232_201|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p232_202|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p232_203|A deadline is still essential.
p232_204|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p232_205|It's a mixture of everything.
p232_206|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p232_207|I don't want to use it.
p232_208|Now, it's all right.
p232_209|There was an e-mail.
p232_210|That's the day job.
p232_211|Feel the heat ?
p232_212|He knows a lot.
p232_213|He is slightly confused.
p232_214|She should not be blamed.
p232_215|His third goal was superb.
p232_216|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p232_217|It's not ideal.
p232_218|He seemed to lose his focus.
p232_219|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p232_220|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p232_221|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p232_223|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p232_224|That has been the easy part.
p232_225|We've got the bronze.
p232_226|Mental health is a massive issue.
p232_227|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p232_228|It was good fun.
p232_229|What was the main difference ?
p232_230|I am immensely sad.
p232_231|I'd never seen a play about me.
p232_232|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p232_233|The track is currently covered in snow.
p232_234|But she was.
p232_235|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p232_236|We were awful.
p232_237|However, no further action was taken by police.
p232_238|And thought we would get away with it.
p232_239|It is set in Paris.
p232_240|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p232_241|It's quite nice.
p232_242|It's quite a line-up!
p232_243|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p232_244|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p232_245|Broke the birdie record.
p232_246|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
p232_247|She is well balanced.
p232_248|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p232_249|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p232_250|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p232_251|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p232_252|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p232_253|I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p232_254|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
p232_255|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p232_256|A friendship that will endure.
p232_257|I can't get a job.
p232_258|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p232_259|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p232_260|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p232_261|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p232_262|It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.
p232_263|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p232_264|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p232_265|Blood samples were taken.
p232_266|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p232_267|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p232_268|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p232_269|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p232_270|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p232_271|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p232_272|He is a young man with a new deal.
p232_273|He was also married with two children.
p232_274|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p232_275|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p232_276|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p232_277|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p232_278|They wanted the club to make money.
p232_279|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p232_280|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p232_281|It's a way of life.
p232_282|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p232_283|I am an estate agent.
p232_284|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p232_285|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p232_286|It was a privilege to work for him.
p232_287|It happens from time to time.
p232_288|He looked very sharp.
p232_289|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p232_290|I saw it at a ruck.
p232_291|They were also beside themselves.
p232_292|The attacker died in the crash.
p232_293|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p232_294|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p232_295|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
p232_296|He was obviously very genuine.
p232_297|These figures are truly awful.
p232_298|He should have won.
p232_299|He has retired.
p232_300|What has altered ?
p232_301|I thought it was my only chance.
p232_302|Nothing is safe.
p232_303|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p232_305|They are wrong.
p232_306|It is a road of death.
p232_307|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p232_308|We are in the end game.
p232_309|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p232_310|He was solid.
p232_311|Special measures were needed.
p232_312|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p232_313|I never thought it would take this long.
p232_314|We are a peaceful people.
p232_315|Kids are terrible.
p232_316|It should be equal.
p232_317|Craig is a major concern for us.
p232_318|The home team had an amazing start.
p232_319|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p232_320|Referees are easy targets.
p232_321|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p232_322|However, the groups denied the claims.
p232_323|I came into this world with nothing.
p232_324|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p232_325|Off with their heads.
p232_326|It's not long enough.
p232_327|My view has now completely changed.
p232_328|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p232_329|We agreed to disagree.
p232_330|It could have gone either way.
p232_331|He was then replaced by Ross.
p232_332|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p232_333|I'd like to take the plunge.
p232_334|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p232_335|She did not attend the courtroom.
p232_336|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p232_337|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p232_338|The team for the first game could be this one.
p232_339|They haven't got a hope.
p232_340|Who will do it ?
p232_341|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p232_342|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p232_343|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p232_344|He has to learn.
p232_345|Indeed, it was magical.
p232_346|Tiger is the exception.
p232_347|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p232_348|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p232_349|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p232_350|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p232_351|Everything was an effort.
p232_352|The boat was fantastic.
p232_353|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p232_354|It is long gone.
p232_355|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p232_356|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p232_357|He had played well in that central role.
p232_358|It's not that clear-cut.
p232_359|She is free.
p232_360|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p232_361|I kept going for her.
p232_362|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p232_363|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p232_364|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p232_365|However, it was well worth the wait.
p232_366|It benefits the whole family.
p232_367|He has seen the past.
p232_368|It was one in the afternoon.
p232_369|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p232_370|We will be homeless.
p232_371|The scene is about this ?
p232_372|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p232_373|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p232_374|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p232_375|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p232_376|He could make it.
p232_377|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p232_378|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p232_379|They have not done so this season so far.
p232_380|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p232_381|Well, the big day has arrived.
p232_382|Five members were disciplined.
p232_383|Talks are progressing.
p232_384|There is no signature.
p232_385|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p232_386|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p232_387|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p232_388|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p232_389|It has moved on in the last week.
p232_390|That's the name of the game, though.
p232_391|You thought it was a headache.
p232_392|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p232_393|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p232_394|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p232_395|We're looking for justice.
p233_001|Please call Stella.
p233_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p233_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p233_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p233_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p233_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p233_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p233_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p233_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p233_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p233_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p233_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p233_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p233_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p233_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p233_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p233_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p233_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p233_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p233_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p233_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p233_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p233_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p233_025|We are a service industry.
p233_026|But we will have to wait.
p233_027|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p233_028|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p233_029|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p233_030|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p233_032|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p233_033|This is a central issue.
p233_037|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p233_038|Victory was never in doubt.
p233_039|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p233_040|We are the party of the future.
p233_041|I have never been a member of the council.
p233_042|He was in his element.
p233_043|That means an extra two years.
p233_044|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p233_045|All businesses continue to trade.
p233_046|The man became a reporter.
p233_047|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
p233_048|It is all starting to come together.
p233_049|Part of the complex is historic.
p233_050|The strategy is not without risk.
p233_051|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p233_052|I was released after six days.
p233_053|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p233_054|We are working on it.
p233_055|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
p233_056|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p233_057|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
p233_058|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p233_059|There was no safety net.
p233_060|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
p233_061|You have to be patient.
p233_062|That is all in the past.
p233_063|That could be a mistake.
p233_064|It was an amazing result.
p233_065|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p233_066|He has not been dropped.
p233_067|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p233_068|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p233_070|This time, it might be for real.
p233_071|She did that for the rest of her life.
p233_072|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p233_073|It starts with the script.
p233_074|We were under a bit of pressure.
p233_075|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p233_076|We can all make a mistake.
p233_077|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p233_079|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p233_080|On the night, it was not enough.
p233_081|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p233_082|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p233_083|They were badly prepared for it.
p233_084|It is not a story.
p233_085|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p233_086|How are you, sir ?
p233_087|So is that it, then ?
p233_088|Do I have a favourite ?
p233_089|What do we do ?
p233_090|Why do it otherwise ?
p233_091|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p233_092|They have a further report to make in March.
p233_093|He is in the US.
p233_094|The Festival is prepared to help.
p233_095|By then, he was walking on water.
p233_096|I had a bit in hand.
p233_097|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
p233_098|I cannot wait to get started on it.
p233_099|That is the fact of the matter.
p233_100|It should be a condition of employment.
p233_101|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p233_102|It is much as it has been described.
p233_103|Police said the family was helping with the search.
p233_104|She was there for the start of the campaign.
p233_105|He has become a monster.
p233_106|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p233_107|Everyone had to play the game.
p233_108|In London today, it was business as usual.
p233_109|It is not affected by the sale.
p233_110|We are currently working on the details.
p233_111|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p233_112|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p233_113|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p233_114|It was the eighties.
p233_115|We do not expect any surplus.
p233_116|You had better believe it.
p233_117|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p233_118|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p233_119|My office is bare.
p233_120|I'm delighted about that.
p233_121|I joined a group.
p233_122|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p233_123|Who would be a referee?
p233_125|That's all right then.
p233_126|There were no grounds for his action.
p233_127|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p233_128|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p233_129|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p233_130|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p233_131|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p233_132|He's been the key to everything.
p233_133|It's an amazing landscape!
p233_134|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p233_135|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p233_136|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p233_137|I am now unemployed.
p233_138|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p233_139|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p233_140|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p233_141|Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg.
p233_142|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p233_143|Is that it ?
p233_144|I saw some terrible things.
p233_146|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p233_147|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p233_148|Who would be right ?
p233_149|She died at her home.
p233_150|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p233_151|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p233_152|It is like a football team.
p233_153|It would be a last resort.
p233_154|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p233_155|He will emerge as a world leader.
p233_156|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p233_157|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p233_158|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p233_159|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p233_160|I was so nervous.
p233_161|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p233_162|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p233_163|It is not normal practice.
p233_164|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p233_165|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p233_166|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p233_167|Neither side can win this war.
p233_168|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p233_169|It is so unfair.
p233_170|I will tell you.
p233_171|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p233_172|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p233_173|I have got a wife to feed.
p233_174|It's that sort of night.
p233_175|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p233_176|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p233_177|The release attracted little attention.
p233_178|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p233_179|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p233_180|We've made a couple of albums.
p233_181|They thought they had found a home.
p233_182|He will feel the pain again.
p233_183|I always felt they played for me.
p233_184|Is Saddam a threat ?
p233_185|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p233_186|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p233_187|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p233_188|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p233_189|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p233_190|I was totally wrong.
p233_191|There is no point in looking any further.
p233_192|I've been there.
p233_193|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p233_194|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p233_195|It's a joke.
p233_196|I had a train to catch.
p233_197|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p233_198|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p233_199|However, this idea is never developed.
p233_200|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p233_201|He may need it.
p233_203|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p233_204|It wasn't to be.
p233_208|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p233_209|I have a cold.
p233_210|He had suffered a heart attack.
p233_211|A deadline is still essential.
p233_212|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p233_213|It was worth a photograph.
p233_214|That will be vital.
p233_215|We need to handle it.
p233_216|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p233_217|I had relied on him.
p233_218|His third goal was superb.
p233_220|In each case they were a goal down.
p233_221|The FBI could become involved.
p233_222|Work has started.
p233_223|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p233_224|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p233_225|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p233_226|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p233_228|Mental health is a massive issue.
p233_229|You have to do your research.
p233_230|We played them off the pitch.
p233_231|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p233_232|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p233_233|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p233_234|My neighbours are horrified.
p233_235|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p233_236|I can't wait to meet him.
p233_237|Broke the birdie record.
p233_238|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p233_239|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p233_240|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p233_241|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p233_242|We were extremely poor.
p233_243|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p233_244|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p233_245|I know I'm in a very special position.
p233_246|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p233_247|The salary changes are long overdue.
p233_248|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p233_249|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p233_250|There wasn't a goal.
p233_251|It was a cry for help.
p233_252|A friendship that will endure.
p233_253|This year I understood.
p233_254|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p233_255|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p233_256|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p233_257|I watched a game.
p233_258|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p233_259|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p233_260|I was happily surprised.
p233_261|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p233_262|It is also very valuable.
p233_263|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p233_264|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p233_265|It is not just about pay.
p233_266|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p233_267|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p233_268|Blood samples were taken.
p233_269|They are never here.
p233_270|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p233_271|It looks as though he will be right.
p233_272|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
p233_273|Immediate action must be taken.
p233_274|He is a young man with a new deal.
p233_275|It was an easy decision to come here.
p233_276|It is the same in Sweden.
p233_277|And Michael was just great.
p233_278|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p233_279|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p233_280|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p233_281|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p233_282|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p233_283|I feel pretty good.
p233_284|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p233_285|It was a privilege to work for him.
p233_286|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p233_288|They were too hard.
p233_289|He looked very sharp.
p233_290|All options are open.
p233_291|The attacker died in the crash.
p233_292|It was a virus.
p233_294|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p233_295|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p233_296|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p233_297|Who can predict ?
p233_298|This is a huge confidence boost.
p233_299|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p233_300|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p233_301|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p233_302|I thought it was my only chance.
p233_303|One was a lawyer.
p233_304|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p233_305|They should be swept away.
p233_306|This is a war over our home.
p233_307|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p233_308|I was in daily contact.
p233_309|We want to play at the worlds.
p233_310|This is the culture change in medicine.
p233_311|Is there on his hands ?
p233_312|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p233_313|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p233_314|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p233_315|The problems began a long time ago.
p233_316|My body is clearly capable.
p233_317|We are very strongly behind the bid.
p233_319|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p233_320|My view has now completely changed.
p233_321|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p233_322|We agreed to disagree.
p233_323|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p233_324|I saw some good things.
p233_325|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p233_326|Robert is a special talent.
p233_327|It added to the spectacle.
p233_328|Who was the mystery MP ?
p233_329|He told the court.
p233_330|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p233_331|Who will do it ?
p233_332|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p233_333|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p233_334|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p233_335|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p233_336|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p233_337|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p233_338|Nobody else was with me.
p233_339|I've learned from my mistakes.
p233_340|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p233_341|The composer will conduct.
p233_342|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p233_343|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p233_344|His contract was then not renewed.
p233_345|Eight months later, he was dead.
p233_346|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p233_347|He had played well in that central role.
p233_348|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p233_349|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p233_350|However, it was well worth the wait.
p233_351|He agreed with my proposal.
p233_352|Hartley should know.
p233_353|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p233_354|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p233_355|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p233_356|Also, it is the season of goodwill.
p233_357|Equity declined to comment.
p233_358|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p233_359|He could make it.
p233_360|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
p233_361|They have not done so this season so far.
p233_362|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p233_363|Safety was also an issue.
p233_364|They received a reply from their own managers.
p233_365|But I managed.
p233_366|They play together perfectly.
p233_367|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p233_368|Colour was at the core of his life.
p233_369|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p233_370|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p234_001|Please call Stella.
p234_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p234_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p234_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p234_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p234_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p234_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p234_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p234_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p234_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p234_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p234_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p234_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.

p234_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.

p234_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p234_025|We are a service industry.
p234_026|But we will have to wait.
p234_027|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p234_028|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p234_029|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p234_030|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p234_031|It is on the internet.
p234_032|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p234_033|This is a central issue.
p234_034|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
p234_035|History is in the making.
p234_036|It was sold at a loss.
p234_037|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p234_038|Victory was never in doubt.
p234_039|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p234_040|We are the party of the future.
p234_041|I have never been a member of the council.
p234_042|He was in his element.
p234_043|That means an extra two years.
p234_044|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p234_045|All businesses continue to trade.
p234_046|The man became a reporter.
p234_047|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
p234_048|It is all starting to come together.
p234_049|Part of the complex is historic.
p234_050|The strategy is not without risk.
p234_051|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p234_052|I was released after six days.
p234_053|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p234_054|We are working on it.
p234_055|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
p234_056|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p234_057|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
p234_058|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p234_059|There was no safety net.
p234_060|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
p234_061|You have to be patient.
p234_062|That is all in the past.
p234_063|That could be a mistake.
p234_064|It was an amazing result.
p234_065|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p234_066|He has not been dropped.
p234_067|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p234_068|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p234_069|The market is appalling for initial public offerings.
p234_070|This time, it might be for real.
p234_071|She did that for the rest of her life.
p234_072|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p234_073|It starts with the script.
p234_074|We were under a bit of pressure.
p234_075|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p234_076|We can all make a mistake.
p234_077|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p234_079|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p234_080|On the night, it was not enough.
p234_081|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p234_082|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p234_083|They were badly prepared for it.
p234_084|It is not a story.
p234_085|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p234_086|How are you, sir ?
p234_087|So is that it, then ?
p234_088|Do I have a favourite ?
p234_089|What do we do ?
p234_090|Why do it otherwise ?
p234_091|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p234_092|They have a further report to make in March.
p234_093|He is in the US.
p234_094|The Festival is prepared to help.
p234_095|By then, he was walking on water.
p234_096|I had a bit in hand.
p234_097|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
p234_098|I cannot wait to get started on it.
p234_099|That is the fact of the matter.
p234_100|It should be a condition of employment.
p234_101|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p234_102|It is much as it has been described.
p234_103|Police said the family was helping with the search.
p234_104|She was there for the start of the campaign.
p234_105|He has become a monster.
p234_106|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p234_107|Everyone had to play the game.
p234_108|In London today, it was business as usual.
p234_109|It is not affected by the sale.
p234_110|We are currently working on the details.
p234_111|That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.
p234_112|That would be a serious problem.
p234_113|Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.
p234_114|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
p234_115|She is not a victim.
p234_116|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p234_117|And we had a good response.
p234_118|When we looked at the company.
p234_119|No, the equipment is extra.
p234_120|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p234_121|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
p234_122|That admission is not surprising.
p234_123|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p234_124|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p234_125|There was a lot of resentment.
p234_126|He wanted to record the group.
p234_127|However, it was a different story in the final.
p234_128|The end result is the same.
p234_129|Three days later, he was killed.
p234_130|We are committed to the ban.
p234_131|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
p234_132|The problem was a social problem.
p234_133|He had no money left to run the club.
p234_134|It is not so simple.
p234_135|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p234_136|So, did she meet him ?
p234_137|So what is the campaign about ?
p234_138|And does it ?
p234_139|Are you from the rugby ?
p234_140|Actors like to be in the centre.
p234_141|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
p234_142|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p234_143|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p234_144|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p234_145|I can't even get into the A team.
p234_146|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p234_147|She does not want to speak.
p234_148|It is expected to last a week.
p234_149|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
p234_150|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p234_151|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p234_152|But it is different in different regions.
p234_153|That is the nature of the game.
p234_154|There is a spring in the step.
p234_155|We want to get there.
p234_156|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p234_157|I have a lot of confidence in this team.
p234_158|The players were under pressure.
p234_159|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
p234_160|There is no common ground.
p234_161|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p234_162|In that case, the children were not missing.
p234_163|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p234_164|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p234_165|Anyone can do the sums.
p234_166|At the moment we do not understand it.
p234_167|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p234_168|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
p234_169|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p234_170|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
p234_171|Much of the equipment was new.
p234_172|I have had a good life.
p234_173|Three hours later, the man was free.
p234_174|That was the difference between the sides.
p234_175|They have not been named.
p234_176|I was in a hole.
p234_177|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p234_178|I was always in control.
p234_179|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p234_180|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p234_181|He was asked to quit.
p234_182|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
p234_183|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p234_184|They were not seeking the right to strike.
p234_185|He called for a public inquiry.
p234_186|Tony Blair has had a good conference.
p234_187|As, indeed, they would be.
p234_188|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p234_189|It is simply not true.
p234_190|In light of things, I think I made the right decision.
p234_191|It is not in the public interest.
p234_192|Well, this article is a bit like that.
p234_193|The performance is not there.
p234_194|It would make a lot of sense.
p234_195|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
p234_196|Clearly, they had other problems.
p234_197|He has defended the system.
p234_198|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p234_199|I could not sit in the stands.
p234_200|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p234_201|They have to get that sorted.
p234_202|Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.
p234_203|We can take the city.
p234_204|Are you going to win ?
p234_205|Was it the wife ?
p234_207|What do we want to do that for ?
p234_208|Does the name matter ?
p234_209|I will be in Scotland.
p234_210|It was the story of the second half.
p234_211|The trading conditions are not good.
p234_212|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p234_213|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p234_214|This is an interesting link.
p234_216|It was a management problem in the hospital.
p234_217|Being investor ready is a good start.
p234_218|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
p234_219|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p234_220|This conference was never confirmed.
p234_221|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p234_222|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p234_223|He must have a crack at it.
p234_224|The force is with them.
p234_225|Her experience is certainly limited.
p234_226|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
p234_227|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p234_228|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p234_229|We are waiting for the Minister to come back with an answer.
p234_230|He intends to restart in the spring.
p234_231|He is a good friend.
p234_232|It is the strength of the school.
p234_233|But it may not be all bad news.
p234_234|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p234_235|The conference is the first test.
p234_236|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p234_237|But we are not immune to the problem.
p234_238|I was not overly concerned about this.
p234_239|However, it is not as simple as this.
p234_240|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p234_241|A deadline is still essential.
p234_242|And they were being paid ?
p234_243|Was everything done to save people ?
p234_244|What was the matter for concern ?
p234_245|Do I think about them often ?
p234_246|Is it in the right place ?
p234_247|Did he trip ?
p234_248|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p234_249|You can buy them over the counter, anywhere.
p234_250|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p234_251|We have an election in eight days.
p234_252|It was far from business as usual.
p234_253|It was just another play.
p234_254|From there, they can go anywhere.
p234_255|The world is a good place.
p234_256|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
p234_257|The matter is under appeal.
p234_258|I am delighted for them.
p234_259|It was a great experience.
p234_260|They are difficult awards to decide.
p234_261|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p234_262|His second was a beauty.
p234_263|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p234_264|Scotland played a major part in the project.
p234_265|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p234_266|Not in this production he doesn't.
p234_267|We can certainly build on this.
p234_268|Then was the summer of their discontent.
p234_269|There is a world of difference.
p234_270|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p234_271|Well, it was certainly different.
p234_272|We want this place to work.
p234_273|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p234_274|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p234_275|The statement contained no surprises.
p234_276|The performance continues to improve.
p234_277|That would be a danger.
p234_278|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
p234_279|However, no further action was taken by police.
p234_280|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p234_281|I had to be into it.
p234_282|My view has always been the same.
p234_283|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
p234_284|It is set in Paris.
p234_285|Do you think we're a top nation ?
p234_286|Is our children learning ?
p234_287|How independent is that ?
p234_288|What form did that take ?
p234_289|Are they free ?
p234_290|The party has never fully recovered.
p234_291|In many ways, that is as important.
p234_292|His leader wanted to celebrate.
p234_293|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p234_294|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p234_295|He was good, but not that good.
p234_296|The results are expected within days.
p234_297|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
p234_298|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p234_299|We were well worth the win.
p234_300|And it was this one.
p234_301|But that's another story for another day.
p234_302|But it was also hard.
p234_303|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
p234_304|We're looking for unity in the council.
p234_305|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p234_306|They are not going the length of the pitch.
p234_307|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
p234_308|The concerns are the same.
p234_309|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p234_310|Scotland won by six wickets.
p234_311|It has to be enforced.
p234_312|And we can do it.
p234_313|Every one is a winner.
p234_314|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p234_315|They have set the standard.
p234_316|This is a major property in Edinburgh.
p234_317|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p234_318|The existing structure is in trouble.
p234_319|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
p234_320|He refused to reveal the reasons for the split.
p234_321|You have to count on other people.
p234_322|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p234_323|And he's the real thing.
p234_324|What are they for ?
p234_325|Is there a waiting list ?
p234_326|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p234_327|But it is important for a number of reasons.
p234_328|All of the management has invested in the firm.
p234_329|The family is not interested in the value of the house.
p234_330|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p234_331|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p234_332|But it can be done.
p234_333|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p234_334|We have to be very, very careful.
p234_335|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p234_336|This could be a mistake.
p234_337|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p234_338|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p234_339|I think the overall picture is still strong.
p234_340|That is always a problem.
p234_341|We will deliver at director level.
p236_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p236_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p236_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p236_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p236_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p236_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p236_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p236_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p236_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p236_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p236_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p236_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p236_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p236_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p236_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p236_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p236_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p236_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p236_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p236_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p236_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p236_025|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p236_026|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p236_027|Meetings will also remain private.
p236_028|Because we do not need it.
p236_029|It's going to have a hell of an effect.
p236_030|And we have a singer.
p236_031|He was jailed for four years.
p236_032|He should emerge as the winner.
p236_033|This is a central issue.
p236_034|He works at the airport.
p236_035|It is not for any other purpose.
p236_036|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p236_037|It carried a double message.
p236_038|That means an extra two years.
p236_039|That was the case with David.
p236_040|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p236_041|I needed a change, a new challenge.
p236_042|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p236_043|Their campaign is in disarray.
p236_044|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p236_045|We are working on it.
p236_046|He looks like an Afghan.
p236_047|Everything else is a bonus.
p236_048|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p236_049|This is the interesting part.
p236_050|I haven't been ill at all.
p236_051|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p236_052|That was the difference today.
p236_053|We keep an eye on it.
p236_054|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p236_055|We felt it was sufficient.
p236_056|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p236_057|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p236_058|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
p236_059|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
p236_060|I have proved that in the past.
p236_061|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p236_062|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p236_063|I was as strong as a horse.
p236_064|Then followed a bout of flu.
p236_065|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p236_066|Both men were on one-year contracts.
p236_068|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p236_069|It is a job creation scheme.
p236_070|He was seen as the enemy.
p236_071|It looks like a hit.
p236_072|These people are not big names.
p236_073|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p236_074|We did it for the jersey.
p236_075|The Festival is prepared to help.
p236_076|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p236_077|By then, he was walking on water.
p236_078|He was just a journalist.
p236_079|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p236_080|They lived for their children.
p236_081|We have turned the corner.
p236_083|The Queen Mother is dead.
p236_084|However, the approach is not believed to be hostile.
p236_085|Change will however have to be in euros.
p236_086|It was a big departure.
p236_087|Does it matter ?
p236_088|How do you take them away ?
p236_089|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p236_090|After the match, do you ?
p236_091|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p236_092|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
p236_093|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p236_094|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p236_095|I had a ball today.
p236_096|He refused to name the survivors.
p236_097|That time is not now, however.
p236_098|We created so many chances.
p236_099|Before the game we went for a pint.
p236_100|Our house was very small.
p236_101|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p236_102|It became difficult for me.
p236_103|It's not a lack of effort.
p236_104|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p236_105|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p236_107|They will notice a difference.
p236_108|Football is a passion for many.
p236_109|New Year will be very busy.
p236_110|There's still plenty time left.
p236_111|The result is a vacuum.
p236_112|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
p236_113|You can spend money on housing.
p236_114|The hearing was due to continue today.
p236_115|I can't even get into the A team.
p236_116|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p236_117|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p236_118|Three hours later, the man was free.
p236_119|Which can happen any time.
p236_120|The colours are very pretty.
p236_121|He is a lovely man.
p236_122|Becoming a father was wonderful.
p236_123|I was on a roll.
p236_124|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p236_125|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
p236_126|He said to give a local injection.
p236_127|They made such decisions in London.
p236_128|You are a gambling man.
p236_129|Before it was an ordeal.
p236_130|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p236_131|We will try to find someone.
p236_132|They could use a boost.
p236_133|She died at her home.
p236_134|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
p236_135|I enjoy the creative process.
p236_136|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
p236_137|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p236_138|It was a piece of art.
p236_139|That view has not altered.
p236_140|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p236_141|So I got a blood test.
p236_142|It has become a way of life.
p236_143|The whole industry is a shambles.
p236_144|Like the others, he was arrested.
p236_145|We will provide immediate access.
p236_146|He could do nothing about it.
p236_147|We have a clean bill of health.
p236_148|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p236_149|I was shaking on the blocks.
p236_151|It was by the numbers.
p236_152|It would seem a natural progression.
p236_153|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p236_154|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p236_155|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
p236_156|It was a funny feeling.
p236_157|I'm afraid to say anything.
p236_158|We did what we had to do.
p236_159|It's not like us.
p236_161|It is not a financial issue.
p236_162|I have got a wife to feed.
p236_163|Seven people were later detained by police.
p236_164|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
p236_165|We have a budget in March.
p236_166|He is not a team captain.
p236_167|Greenwood said he was happy with that.
p236_168|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p236_169|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p236_170|That is not the case.
p236_172|It's nice to be nice.
p236_173|They could not match it.
p236_174|Are they free ?
p236_175|What are they for ?
p236_176|Is there a waiting list ?
p236_177|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p236_178|So what happens next ?
p236_179|Had this been common practice ?
p236_180|What do they want us to do ?
p236_181|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
p236_182|One season, they might do well.
p236_183|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p236_184|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p236_185|It is not either national standards or local control.
p236_186|City sentiment is in his favour.
p236_187|The hotel was now for sale.
p236_188|We are the gateway to justice.
p236_189|Tomorrow is a new day.
p236_190|It makes no influence on the public.
p236_191|Each case is treated on merit.
p236_192|I have spoken to head office.
p236_193|Says the Duke of York.
p236_194|I had too much to drink.
p236_195|As many as the market will support.
p236_196|They need to look after themselves.
p236_197|That is a waste of energy.
p236_198|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
p236_199|It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.
p236_200|I had a train to catch.
p236_201|It shows the strength of the roots.
p236_202|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p236_203|This youngster is so exciting!
p236_204|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p236_205|It caused a lot of upset.
p236_206|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p236_207|My duty is to win.
p236_208|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
p236_209|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p236_210|No details of the talks were given.
p236_211|This will be our new beginning.
p236_212|They have the cash and the fire power.
p236_213|The service from the other players was super.
p236_214|The early physical reports were clear.
p236_215|Tommy is not a problem.
p236_216|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p236_217|John Daly has a burning ambition.
p236_218|A deadline is still essential.
p236_219|You have caught a serial killer.
p236_220|You are a great player.
p236_221|I won't make an official complaint.
p236_222|It was worth a photograph.
p236_223|They are looking at a flotation.
p236_224|Which isn't a bad idea.
p236_225|There is no quick fix.
p236_226|There was a lot of resentment.
p236_227|That might help a bit.
p236_228|From there, they can go anywhere.
p236_229|Death is outside the language.
p236_230|I had relied on him.
p236_231|The course has helped a lot.
p236_232|I'm just a regular person.
p236_233|It had all been arranged.
p236_234|His third goal was superb.
p236_235|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p236_236|I am considered a teenager.
p236_237|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p236_238|This will secure the future of our industry.
p236_239|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p236_240|People should make their own decisions.
p236_241|They said that they stood by their statement.
p236_242|You have to do your research.
p236_243|We played them off the pitch.
p236_244|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p236_245|Truth is the child of time.
p236_246|And they were being paid ?
p236_247|Was everything done to save people ?
p236_249|Do I think about them often ?
p236_250|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
p236_251|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p236_252|It's important to get it right.
p236_253|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p236_254|Those overseas offices were great.
p236_255|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
p236_256|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p236_257|I was just a kid.
p236_258|He was good, but not that good.
p236_259|It was quite a new prescription.
p236_260|It is very hard for her.
p236_261|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p236_262|It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.
p236_263|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p236_264|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p236_265|You can feel at home in China.
p236_266|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p236_267|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
p236_268|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p236_269|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p236_270|But they were never expected to last.
p236_271|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
p236_272|The capital costs are modest.
p236_273|I told you I was ill.
p236_274|He will go on the bench.
p236_275|That could be in place by next year.
p236_276|We accept the new rules.
p236_277|We run within the law.
p236_278|We have the moral high ground.
p236_279|He took over our lives.
p236_280|It has all been done in secret.
p236_281|They must play for each other.
p236_282|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p236_283|She always wanted her own way.
p236_284|I realised I was lucky to have it.
p236_285|They can leave at any time.
p236_286|Much of the equipment was new.
p236_287|Blair also had a penalty.
p236_288|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p236_289|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p236_290|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p236_291|My body is a wreck.
p236_292|She failed in her action.
p236_293|Stephen will get his first cap.
p236_294|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p236_295|And that match was played in June.
p236_296|I saw it at a ruck.
p236_297|What do we want to do that for ?
p236_298|Does the name matter ?
p236_299|how do you get it back ?
p236_300|What are you not good at ?
p236_301|I think, therefore I am ?
p236_302|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p236_303|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p236_304|He will address the nation this evening.
p236_305|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p236_306|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p236_307|The rescue package is public money.
p236_308|I was there five months ago.
p236_309|I am a retailer by nature.
p236_310|His job was not advertised.
p236_311|We can work all night.
p236_312|It was really very frightening.
p236_313|It was an excellent performance.
p236_314|The answer is with ourselves.
p236_315|And we can do it.
p236_316|These figures are truly awful.
p236_317|That is the real test.
p236_318|They have to be addressed.
p236_319|It aims to produce its report before Christmas.
p236_320|Cast Away now on general release.
p236_321|All winners should be tested.
p236_322|I can live with it.
p236_323|A lot has been written.
p236_324|And he goes with it.
p236_325|The law will take its course.
p236_326|This is a historic occasion.
p236_327|This ruling is a farce.
p236_328|After some discussion they did.
p236_329|I am not obsessed with sex.
p236_330|I didn't have the reply.
p236_331|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p236_332|These days will be back.
p236_333|You may have a short memory.
p236_335|There was no time scale.
p236_336|That decision has already been made.
p236_337|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p236_338|The game is now open.
p236_339|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p236_340|Even the one she loved.
p236_341|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p236_342|It was almost too much.
p236_343|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p236_344|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p236_345|Three years ago he would have been.
p236_346|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p236_347|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p236_348|The confidence isn't there now.
p236_349|We put our bid in last night.
p236_350|A great deal has been achieved.
p236_351|He had no previous convictions.
p236_352|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p236_353|What do we do ?
p236_354|Why do it otherwise ?
p236_355|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p236_356|So, did she meet him ?
p236_357|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p236_358|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p236_359|Scotland is the home of golf.
p236_360|They have broken that promise.
p236_361|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p236_362|It's only a matter of scale.
p236_363|We must put a marker down.
p236_364|She said they would appeal.
p236_365|There is no deal as yet.
p236_366|It's as wide as a church in here.
p236_367|The work with Alison was a great experience.
p236_368|It was like a weekly wage.
p236_369|We are a Scottish company.
p236_370|They will fight for everything.
p236_371|The pair are very much in love.
p236_372|We used to keep our business rates.
p236_373|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p236_374|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p236_375|Everyone could see the joke.
p236_376|All would be under threat.
p236_377|I understand the frustration of the fans.
p236_378|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p236_379|The seller was not revealed.
p236_380|People are on the alert.
p236_381|I can confirm that Miss Deacon has received a threatening phone call.
p236_382|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p236_383|A review is under way.
p236_384|They know it'll be fantastic.
p236_385|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p236_386|Clark is back on top form.
p236_387|Motion described it as a unique event.
p236_388|It brought in new management.
p236_389|My view has now completely changed.
p236_390|She is in their hands.
p236_391|The following day I used the story.
p236_392|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p236_393|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p236_394|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p236_395|I should think so, too.
p236_396|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p236_397|How are you, sir ?
p236_398|So is that it, then ?
p236_399|Do I have a favourite ?
p236_400|It certainly appeared that way.
p236_401|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p236_402|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
p236_403|I will be able to say in a couple of weeks.
p236_404|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p236_405|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
p236_406|It had been on the cards.
p236_407|He seems to be used to the attention.
p236_408|The trick is to try it.
p236_409|I would love to think that she could win.
p236_410|He may have a point.
p236_411|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p236_412|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p236_413|He is on the wrong side.
p236_414|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p236_415|I've got my own ideas.
p236_416|I never had a childhood.
p236_417|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p236_418|I think it's a miracle.
p236_419|They were not complacent in any way.
p236_420|They did the right thing.
p236_421|He will be judged by his actions.
p236_422|The fate of the rest is unknown.
p236_423|It is an absolute nonsense.
p236_424|Young families accounted for a growing share of the trade.
p236_425|Sadly, the surface was a nightmare.
p236_426|Everything in golf is a balance.
p236_427|It is a case of pity for us.
p236_428|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p236_429|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p236_430|We've got a good management record.
p236_431|It was that bad, that low.
p236_432|Paris is not only young.
p236_433|However, the downturn has forced the overdraft request.
p236_434|But you can go beyond that condition.
p236_435|But we have built a platform for next season.
p236_436|It looked like a war zone.
p236_437|He said current trading was strong.
p236_438|I chose to make a film.
p236_439|I can tell you Labour is fighting to win.
p236_440|But by that time, it was too late.
p236_441|The damage is all inside.
p236_442|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p236_443|We would have concerns about that.
p236_444|I know the worry over Iraq.
p236_445|Taxes may need to rise.
p236_446|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
p236_447|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
p236_448|No options are excluded at all.
p236_449|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p236_450|We are going for it.
p236_451|Miss Jackson was not present to put her case.
p236_452|It is a cause for concern.
p236_453|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
p236_454|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p236_455|He deserved a red card.
p236_456|They were not even allowed to see them.
p236_457|And she is very clear on this.
p236_458|And it covers the spectrum.
p236_459|Dennis was not so sure.
p236_460|The chief constable has retired.
p236_461|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p236_462|It is a crisis, without a doubt.
p236_463|Not if you know the person.
p236_464|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p236_465|I was all image and no substance.
p236_466|The boys are mentally focused.
p236_467|It can all be done over the phone.
p236_468|The bill would be massive.
p236_469|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p236_470|Neither woman has been named.
p236_471|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p236_472|We live by the rule of law.
p236_473|They make a selective perception process.
p236_474|He was a shooting star.
p236_475|I could feel the blood on my face.
p236_476|I am a committed European.
p236_477|Analysts said the offer was fair.
p236_478|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
p236_479|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p236_480|It is a vicious circle.
p236_481|He will be advised by me.
p236_482|Winning a medal is a dream.
p236_483|We had to add value.
p237_001|Please call Stella.
p237_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p237_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p237_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p237_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p237_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p237_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p237_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p237_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p237_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p237_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p237_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p237_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p237_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p237_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p237_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p237_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p237_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p237_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p237_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p237_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p237_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p237_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p237_025|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p237_026|They should be so lucky.
p237_027|I have a theory.
p237_028|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p237_029|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p237_030|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p237_031|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p237_032|There's a story, too.
p237_033|This is the window.
p237_034|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
p237_035|I'd like to continue that record.
p237_036|They're just different.
p237_037|It was clear.
p237_038|It is not for any other purpose.
p237_039|The problem is the pitch.
p237_040|It's a great thing.
p237_041|He did not know his daughter.
p237_042|This film will be totally awesome.
p237_043|That is a break with tradition.
p237_044|It's the only thing.
p237_045|It is so sad.
p237_046|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p237_047|It is urgent.
p237_048|I feel pretty good.
p237_049|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p237_050|It is bizarre.
p237_051|That should do it.
p237_052|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p237_053|She looked so young.
p237_054|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p237_055|Life is good.
p237_056|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p237_057|I was inspired by two things.
p237_058|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p237_059|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p237_060|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
p237_061|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p237_062|None has ever been found.
p237_063|It's a real challenge.
p237_064|You do not change overnight.
p237_065|Art is extra.
p237_066|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p237_067|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p237_068|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p237_069|It is like a river running by my home.
p237_070|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p237_071|Try to save us.
p237_072|The end result is precisely the same.
p237_073|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p237_074|Painful, but only because it's true.
p237_075|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p237_076|The price cuts are really exciting.
p237_077|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p237_078|It is a terrible place.
p237_079|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p237_080|It may well have been.
p237_081|It's all going to clear the debt.
p237_082|I first met him last summer.
p237_083|He is driven.
p237_084|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p237_085|Someone who cares
p237_086|It's never too late.
p237_087|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p237_088|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p237_089|Now the system is right behind us.
p237_090|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p237_091|Today I couldn't run on it.
p237_092|However, it did not end that way.
p237_093|We must look forward.
p237_094|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p237_095|Until you hit the big games.
p237_096|We could not get any possession.
p237_097|I love the Dome.
p237_098|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p237_099|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p237_100|They were outside the circle.
p237_101|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p237_102|But it was a pleasure.
p237_103|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p237_104|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p237_105|I didn't play well last year.
p237_106|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p237_107|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p237_108|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p237_109|It is normal.
p237_110|Further protests are likely.
p237_111|It's in his blood.
p237_112|Who would be right ?
p237_113|It's a shame.
p237_114|I came to complete.
p237_117|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p237_118|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p237_119|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p237_120|Does this mean.
p237_121|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p237_122|It is a delight on every level.
p237_123|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p237_124|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p237_125|But it took a lot of bottle.
p237_126|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p237_127|I'm so angry.
p237_128|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p237_129|She really suffered for her art.
p237_130|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p237_131|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p237_132|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p237_133|Who will attend ?
p237_134|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p237_135|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p237_136|They made such decisions in London.
p237_137|It's perfectly feasible.
p237_138|They took a risk.
p237_139|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
p237_140|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p237_141|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p237_142|He has the edge.
p237_143|Three penalties were given.
p237_144|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p237_145|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p237_146|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p237_147|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p237_148|He is severe.
p237_149|She died at her home.
p237_150|Is that Titanic ?
p237_151|The idea is simple.
p237_153|He will emerge as a world leader.
p237_154|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p237_155|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p237_156|It is huge.
p237_157|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p237_159|It is not normal practice.
p237_160|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p237_161|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p237_162|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p237_163|We are now up against it.
p237_164|I was in daily contact.
p237_165|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
p237_166|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p237_167|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p237_168|They should stop the bombing.
p237_169|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p237_170|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p237_171|I was in the train station overnight.
p237_172|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p237_173|He is keen to stay in public service.
p237_174|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
p237_175|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p237_176|Does that put pressure on us ?
p237_177|The release attracted little attention.
p237_178|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p237_179|He was a crazy man.
p237_180|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p237_181|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p237_182|One season, they might do well.
p237_183|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p237_184|This is a sad day.
p237_185|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p237_186|The hotel was now for sale.
p237_187|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p237_188|Government will intervene.
p237_189|Four policemen were wounded.
p237_190|They receive a high profile in the media.
p237_191|It's a joke.
p237_192|Miller was every bit as happy.
p237_193|I wish I could say something.
p237_194|It is tough, but possible.
p237_195|I've got good news and bad news for you.
p237_196|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p237_198|If the director is with you.
p237_199|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p237_200|It is a case of taking a risk.
p237_201|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p237_202|Our strategy is straightforward.
p237_203|Is that success ?
p237_204|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p237_205|Tommy is not a problem.
p237_206|The sisters also became the two top players in the world.
p237_207|He was also married with two children.
p237_208|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p237_210|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p237_211|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p237_212|I don't want to use it.
p237_213|Now, it's all right.
p237_214|There was an e-mail.
p237_215|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
p237_216|It is a gamble.
p237_217|He is slightly confused.
p237_218|She should not be blamed.
p237_219|I began to pray.
p237_220|I had decided to quit the show.
p237_221|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
p237_222|By hard work, is the answer.
p237_223|The FBI could become involved.
p237_224|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p237_225|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p237_226|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p237_227|You have to do your research.
p237_228|William Hague delighted his party.
p237_229|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p237_230|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p237_231|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p237_232|I am immensely sad.
p237_233|I'd never seen a play about me.
p237_234|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p237_235|I can't wait to meet him.
p237_236|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p237_237|They are the innocent victims.
p237_238|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
p237_239|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p237_240|You take a risk.
p237_241|They tried to give her advice.
p237_242|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p237_243|It's a dead end.
p237_244|We are in the hat.
p237_245|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p237_246|They should come forward.
p237_247|It is not the message alone.
p237_248|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p237_249|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p237_250|It's quite a line-up !
p237_251|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p237_252|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p237_253|We were extremely poor.
p237_254|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p237_255|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
p237_256|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p237_257|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p237_258|Both reports appear in the British Medical Journal.
p237_259|You can feel at home in China.
p237_260|Our decision making was poor.
p237_262|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p237_263|They are different types.
p237_264|There's the mix.
p237_265|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p237_266|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p237_267|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p237_268|That could be in place by next year.
p237_270|Special measures were needed.
p237_271|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p237_272|This is a big club.
p237_273|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p237_274|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p237_275|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
p237_276|It is also very valuable.
p237_277|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p237_278|The warning is timely.
p237_279|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p237_280|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p237_281|There is no link.
p237_282|This is a question of Islam.
p237_283|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p237_284|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p237_285|Immediate action must be taken.
p237_286|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p237_287|We're in shock.
p237_288|You know the type.
p237_289|She failed in her action.
p237_290|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p237_291|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p237_292|They seem to get away with it.
p237_293|People have no choice.
p237_294|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p237_295|I saw it at a ruck.
p237_296|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p237_297|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p237_298|Holland won by five wickets.
p237_299|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p237_300|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p237_301|That could change.
p237_302|He should have won.
p237_303|Who can predict ?
p237_304|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p237_305|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p237_306|I was the sheep.
p237_307|Graeme was prepared.
p237_308|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p237_309|It is a road of death.
p237_310|This is a war over our home.
p237_311|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p237_312|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p237_313|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p237_314|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p237_315|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p237_316|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p237_317|It is no surprise.
p237_318|We want to play at the worlds.
p237_320|They were fantastic.
p237_321|I never thought it would take this long.
p237_322|They wanted the club to make money.
p237_323|It should be equal.
p237_325|We are very strongly behind the bid.
p237_326|In the old days, it was easy.
p237_327|The parents will have a great time, too.
p237_328|It is a job creation scheme.
p237_329|I am so upset.
p237_330|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p238_001|Please call Stella.
p238_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p238_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p238_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p238_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p238_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p238_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p238_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p238_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p238_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p238_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p238_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p238_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p238_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p238_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p238_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p238_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p238_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p238_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p238_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p238_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p238_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p238_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p238_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p238_025|Smoking is also very important.
p238_026|The first appeared to be successful.
p238_027|We must convince the citizens.
p238_028|There was a rush of water.
p238_029|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p238_030|Further management changes are planned.
p238_031|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p238_032|The staff are very good.
p238_033|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p238_034|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p238_035|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p238_036|Let there be no doubt about that.
p238_037|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p238_038|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
p238_039|And so was a photograph.
p238_040|I remember that day well.
p238_041|She became a heroine of my childhood.
p238_042|We want to get back into the Champions League.
p238_043|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p238_044|It is about regular committed giving which is the real attraction.
p238_045|This represents a tough game for us.
p238_046|Separate approvals would be needed for these.
p238_047|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p238_048|Among them are many criminals.
p238_049|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p238_050|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
p238_051|And they removed a Borderer.
p238_052|He is too weak to move.
p238_053|Does it matter ?
p238_054|How do you take them away ?
p238_055|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p238_056|After the match, do you ?
p238_057|Has the conflict started ?
p238_058|Have I really come to this ?
p238_059|They desperately want some stability.
p238_060|Well, he is an artist.
p238_061|We work for the athlete.
p238_062|He looks like an Afghan.
p238_063|Everything else is a bonus.
p238_064|He will need that machine.
p238_065|We hadn't really taken that seriously before.
p238_066|It's the performance we want.
p238_067|Then they scored two goals to win.
p238_068|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
p238_069|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p238_070|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p238_071|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p238_072|I had relied on him.
p238_073|And then there's the racial hassle.
p238_074|We felt it was sufficient.
p238_075|The wingers must have felt the cold.
p238_076|I am relishing the challenge.
p238_077|I have made that offer.
p238_078|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p238_079|But the organisers refused to worry.
p238_080|We have to keep our clients.
p238_081|We should be able to cope.
p238_082|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p238_083|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
p238_084|He's very young and very keen to do well.
p238_085|It is somewhere to be.
p238_086|We should all be grateful.
p238_087|We will pay their bills.
p238_088|It was exactly four months away.
p238_089|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
p238_090|He thought she was amazing.
p238_091|The result is utterly compelling.
p238_092|Final proposals will be published in February.
p238_093|He seems to have everything.
p238_094|There can be no compromise on welfare.
p238_095|It wasn't possible to relax.
p238_096|He was at home with his pals.
p238_097|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p238_098|Maybe this battle has been.
p238_099|Then followed a bout of flu.
p238_100|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p238_101|It will take a few years before we see the full benefit.
p238_102|It's very dangerous for markets.
p238_103|The fans would love it.
p238_104|That would be the case with Dundee.
p238_105|Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.
p238_106|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p238_107|Their mandate is to target inflation.
p238_108|We have thought about doing lots of things.
p238_109|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p238_110|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p238_111|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p238_112|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p238_113|Those people must be accountable.
p238_114|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
p238_115|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
p238_116|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p238_117|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
p238_118|It's going to be epic.
p238_119|What form did that take ?
p238_120|Are they free ?
p238_121|What are they for ?
p238_122|Is there a waiting list ?
p238_123|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p238_124|So what happens next ?
p238_125|Had this been common practice ?
p238_126|What do they want us to do ?
p238_127|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p238_128|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p238_129|They lived for their children.
p238_130|Potions said he would drive.
p238_131|This is a sizeable part of our business.
p238_132|Diversions were put in place.
p238_133|We're very interested in opening up in Germany.
p238_134|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
p238_135|No one person or small group could be singled out.
p238_136|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p238_137|I won't make an official complaint.
p238_138|Monty is great in his own backyard.
p238_139|Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
p238_140|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p238_141|Even the winning club was within seconds of disaster.
p238_142|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p238_143|But it looks good for next year.

p238_145|His claims were criticised by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith.
p238_146|Four meetings have previously been arranged.
p238_147|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
p238_148|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p238_149|And they all have a vote.
p238_150|It is a vicious circle.
p238_151|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p238_152|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p238_154|They make a selective perception process.
p238_155|That's what happened against Ayr.
p238_156|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
p238_157|The following are the principal provisions.
p238_158|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p238_159|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p238_160|His job was not advertised.
p238_161|He was just like a godfather to it.
p238_162|The milk industry is in turmoil.
p238_163|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p238_164|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p238_165|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p238_166|YOU cannot blame the turnout.
p238_167|We can't get over it.
p238_168|They almost achieved a draw.
p238_169|I can see it now.
p238_170|This is a step backwards.
p238_171|I've no idea how it works.
p238_172|We continue to hold the shares.
p238_173|The festivals will be about having fun.
p238_174|Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
p238_175|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p238_176|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p238_177|The changes took effect from June.
p238_178|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p238_179|You can spend money on housing.
p238_180|Since then, things have improved.
p238_181|We're very fortunate to have these new products to focus on.
p238_182|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p238_183|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
p238_184|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p238_185|But we could only help a handful of people.
p238_186|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
p238_187|This is a frightening development.
p238_188|He is survived by his wife and two sons.
p238_189|This should begin in October.
p238_190|You just have to accept.
p238_191|There is no evidence that these people are helpful.
p238_192|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p238_193|The squad is too small.
p238_194|He has had success at every level.
p238_195|This Patton will also return.
p238_196|Tiger is not the norm.
p238_197|His words were not audible.
p238_198|You are a gambling man.
p238_199|Did he trip ?
p238_200|Does that put pressure on us ?
p238_201|Did it work ?
p238_202|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p238_203|Is our children learning ?
p238_204|How independent is that ?
p238_206|Truth is the child of time.
p238_207|There was a fine line to tread.
p238_208|The refund is fully justified.
p238_209|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p238_211|But experts have disputed that statistic.
p238_212|It is time for confession.
p238_213|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p238_214|Hospital staff described his condition as serious but stable.
p238_215|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p238_216|It was started almost by accident.
p238_217|I will not take part in Edmonton.
p238_218|We will try to find someone.
p238_219|Bottling is now the core business.
p238_220|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p238_221|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
p238_222|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p238_223|We were right to be afraid.
p238_224|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p238_225|That group reported just before Christmas.
p238_226|I am considered a teenager.
p238_227|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p238_228|Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
p238_229|That view has not altered.
p238_230|Its's all change at Kilmarnock.
p238_231|So I got a blood test.
p238_232|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p238_233|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
p238_234|There's always the next century.
p238_235|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
p238_236|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
p238_237|Here was an anti supporting the Bill.
p238_238|Five years later, the deception continued.
p238_239|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
p238_240|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p238_241|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p238_242|It is not normal practice.
p238_243|It is crucial for both teams.
p238_244|Mr Blair had done well.
p238_245|I was a lucky man tonight.
p238_246|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p238_247|But it couldn't happen overnight.
p238_248|It would seem a natural progression.
p238_249|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p238_250|My Dad is a hero.
p238_251|And they were being paid ?
p238_252|was everything done to save people ?
p238_253|What was the matter for concern ?
p238_254|Do I think about them often ?
p238_255|Is it in the right place ?
p238_256|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p238_257|It was a terrible combination of factors.
p238_258|This is absolutely not true.
p238_259|Arsenal refused to be evicted.
p238_260|It's about time something was done about equipment.
p238_261|They should stop the bombing.
p238_262|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p238_263|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p238_264|It is a terrible tragedy.
p238_265|The agreement remains the only show in town.
p238_266|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p238_267|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p238_268|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p238_269|It was a bit of a tightrope.
p238_270|It's never great to finish second.
p238_271|I'm delighted that Celtic have done so well this season.
p238_272|Her political persuasion is no secret.
p238_273|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
p238_274|He is a right bastard.
p238_275|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
p238_276|They could not match it.
p238_277|He is not a pathetic figure.
p238_278|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p238_279|I came up through the ranks.
p238_280|You've got to be vigilant.
p238_281|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p238_282|The happiness was slightly misplaced.
p238_283|Phase one was a shambles.
p238_284|This championship is different from the other majors.
p238_285|But I was glad to see these interviews.
p238_286|Each case is treated on merit.
p238_287|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p238_288|Says the Duke of York.
p238_289|He is a serial Conservative assassin.
p238_290|We've just had it confirmed.
p238_291|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
p238_292|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p238_293|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
p238_294|We've had great things in the past.
p238_295|It has been recorded twice.
p238_296|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p238_297|I'm interested in interesting work.
p238_298|They will probably come back.
p238_299|What do we want to do that for ?
p238_300|Does the name matter ?
p238_301|how do you get it back ?
p238_302|What are you not good at ?
p238_303|I think, therefore I am ?
p238_304|Who was she ?
p238_305|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p238_306|No-one is predicting a sudden rebound.
p238_307|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p238_308|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p238_309|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p238_310|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p238_311|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p238_312|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p238_313|Movie stars are public property.
p238_314|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p238_315|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p238_316|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
p238_317|Here the picture is broadly stable.
p238_318|Sadly, it does not end there.
p238_319|Jim has not been a problem for me at all.
p238_320|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
p238_321|We believe a third party was involved.
p238_322|And we have the experience.
p238_323|The early physical reports were clear.
p238_324|Celtic were the losers then.
p238_325|Their conclusions were never published.
p238_326|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p238_327|Little is known about them.
p238_328|Margins are also in retreat.
p238_329|Golf is not like that.
p238_330|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
p238_331|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p238_332|Which isn't a bad idea.
p238_333|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p238_334|They will always be in our hearts and in our minds.
p238_335|He was admitted to hospital.
p238_336|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p238_337|Abbey National is an option.
p238_338|We've had him with us for the past six weeks.
p238_339|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
p238_340|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p238_341|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p238_342|He is the son of former chairman, Lord Wolfson.
p238_343|Scottish consumer protection groups were generally receptive to the proposals.
p238_344|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
p238_345|My daughter is an adult.
p238_346|His third goal was superb.
p238_347|I'm very relieved that I have finally won.
p238_349|My father died in childbirth.
p238_350|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p238_351|So, did she meet him ?
p238_352|So what is the campaign about ?
p238_353|This measure is not adjusted for seasonal factors.
p238_354|They're going to open in early summer.
p238_355|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p238_356|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p238_357|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p238_358|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p238_359|People should make their own decisions.
p238_360|I saw them last week.
p238_361|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p238_362|It was a good workout.
p238_363|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p238_364|William Hague delighted his party.
p238_365|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p238_366|We played them off the pitch.
p238_368|We can have no complaints.
p238_369|The statement contained no surprises.
p238_370|Not that Barber has been unhappy.
p238_371|We will likely look for new investors.
p238_372|But the rally was short-lived.
p238_373|But you never won any games.
p238_374|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p238_375|And he goes with it.
p238_376|I have little time for analysts.
p238_377|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
p238_378|It was really quite amazing.
p238_379|It represents a complete change in emphasis.
p238_380|It is the voice of the survivors.
p238_381|It was cynical and callous.
p238_382|He did not say that.
p238_383|So is that it, then ?
p238_384|Do I have a favourite ?
p238_385|What do we do ?
p238_386|Why do it otherwise ?
p238_387|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p238_388|His successor was only appointed last month.
p238_389|I've had three shots and got nowhere near.
p238_390|It's difficult to put a date on.
p238_391|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p238_392|Those overseas offices were great.
p238_393|You will have seen the adverts.
p238_394|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
p238_395|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p238_396|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
p238_397|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
p238_398|Standard Life has also highlighted ambitions in this market.
p238_399|Colin is free to speak with other teams.
p238_400|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
p238_401|He left the hospital without receiving any medication.
p238_402|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p238_403|That remains the unanswered question.
p238_404|Everything has its place and purpose.
p238_405|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
p238_406|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p238_407|And it had two seats.
p238_408|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p238_409|How are you, sir ?
p238_410|But nothing could be done.
p238_411|This is a historic occasion.
p238_412|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p238_413|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p238_414|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p238_415|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p238_416|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p238_417|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p238_418|We have no information on Iraq.
p238_419|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p238_420|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p238_421|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p238_422|The company declined to comment.
p238_423|It also makes a habit of collecting people.
p238_424|Got to get my sunglasses.
p238_425|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p238_426|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p238_427|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p238_428|Messages have to be reinforced.
p238_429|Not many people like to do that.
p238_430|We accept the new rules.
p238_431|We go there with confidence.
p238_432|It was like the old days.
p238_433|They are interior designers and architects.
p238_434|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
p238_435|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
p238_436|The only problem was, they were on himself.
p238_437|We are aiming for early March.
p238_438|We discovered that for ourselves.
p238_439|It is also very valuable.
p239_001|Please call Stella.
p239_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p239_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p239_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p239_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p239_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p239_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p239_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p239_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p239_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p239_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p239_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p239_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p239_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p239_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p239_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p239_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p239_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p239_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p239_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p239_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p239_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p239_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p239_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p239_025|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
p239_026|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p239_027|And so was a photograph.
p239_028|We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage.
p239_029|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
p239_030|It is about control of our economy.
p239_031|There was a rush of water.
p239_032|That's all I was trying to do today.
p239_033|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p239_034|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p239_035|I might well have done so already.
p239_036|That can cost him a fortune.
p239_037|He works at the airport.
p239_038|How do you take them away ?
p239_039|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p239_040|After the match, do you ?
p239_041|Has the conflict started ?
p239_042|Have I really come to this ?
p239_043|This matter has still to come before the European Parliament.
p239_044|It carried a double message.
p239_045|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p239_046|But not a penny has been paid.
p239_047|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p239_048|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
p239_049|We must learn to finish.
p239_050|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p239_051|New York is my home.
p239_052|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p239_053|I remember that day well.
p239_054|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p239_055|He is too weak to move.
p239_056|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p239_057|I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.
p239_058|Among them are many criminals.
p239_059|That's been the difference between the sides.
p239_060|And they removed a Borderer.
p239_061|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
p239_062|Perhaps we should do the same.
p239_063|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p239_064|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p239_065|They desperately want some stability.
p239_066|Everything is possible in football.
p239_067|Everyone could see the joke.
p239_068|I'm pleased with the horse.
p239_069|He will need that machine.
p239_070|The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV.
p239_071|Then they scored two goals to win.
p239_072|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
p239_073|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p239_074|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p239_075|Let's not be too despondent.
p239_076|The Government does not go far enough.
p239_077|He phoned the number in the brochure.
p239_078|I haven't got there yet.
p239_079|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p239_080|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p239_081|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p239_082|Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family.
p239_083|But the organisers refused to worry.
p239_084|And it had two seats.
p239_085|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p239_086|Or so the theory goes.
p239_087|He has really done well.
p239_088|So what happens next ?
p239_089|Had this been common practice ?
p239_090|What do they want us to do ?
p239_091|Is it worth it ?
p239_092|Does it matter ?
p239_093|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p239_094|But I had never been in a theatre.
p239_095|It was fun, but not a living.
p239_096|Kenny Miller might come through.
p239_097|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p239_098|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p239_099|We will pay their bills.
p239_100|Sales are falling after years of growth.
p239_101|It was exactly four months away.
p239_102|But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.
p239_103|We have a major concern about enforcement action.
p239_104|I am so proud of him.
p239_105|This time, it might be for real.
p239_106|He will be kept informed.
p239_107|There could be a way back.
p239_108|He was a lovely man.
p239_109|People will have to be patient.
p239_110|I can't remember a lot of it.
p239_111|Instead, another depression came in.
p239_112|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p239_113|We have thought about doing lots of things.
p239_114|It is sometimes like that.
p239_115|The partners are looking for answers.
p239_116|I've had it for the exams.
p239_117|Those people must be accountable.
p239_118|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p239_119|The Festival is prepared to help.
p239_120|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p239_121|The error appeared in a warrant.
p239_122|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p239_123|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p239_124|He was just a journalist.
p239_125|They lived for their children.
p239_126|Their season has been consigned to history.
p239_127|Diversions were put in place.
p239_128|How independent is that ?
p239_129|What form did that take ?
p239_130|Are they free ?
p239_131|What are they for ?
p239_132|Is there a waiting list ?
p239_133|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p239_134|Maybe he has been away from British football for too long.
p239_135|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p239_136|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p239_137|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
p239_138|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p239_139|It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
p239_140|So it was at Easter Road.
p239_141|A move to Manchester United would be tremendous.
p239_142|Absences should be carefully monitored.
p239_143|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p239_144|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p239_145|We just have to adapt.
p239_146|He was forced to quit.
p239_147|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p239_148|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
p239_149|I was given no instructions by no-one.
p239_150|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p239_151|Which isn't a bad idea.
p239_152|Since then, things have improved.
p239_153|That's what happened against Ayr.
p239_154|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
p239_155|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
p239_156|It is a good lifestyle.
p239_157|Before the game we went for a pint.
p239_158|Our relationship has been very good.
p239_159|It was the climax of the thing.
p239_160|Nato has left them with no other option.
p239_161|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
p239_162|I think the referee was good.
p239_163|I understand the medical concerns.
p239_164|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p239_165|This was a unique election.
p239_166|They exist in name alone.
p239_167|We have reacted well to each other.
p239_168|I can see it now.
p239_169|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p239_170|There's still plenty time left.
p239_171|Those three weeks are totally lost.
p239_172|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p239_173|She is in good spirits.
p239_174|As if that is an achievement.
p239_175|Mr Blair should be warned.
p239_176|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p239_177|There was a fossil on screen.
p239_178|Is it in the right place ?
p239_179|Did he trip ?
p239_180|Does that put pressure on us ?
p239_181|Did it work ?
p239_182|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p239_183|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p239_184|Structural changes were also required.
p239_185|His job was not advertised.
p239_186|That was just one night.
p239_187|This is a frightening development.
p239_188|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p239_189|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p239_190|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
p239_191|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
p239_192|My father died in childbirth.
p239_193|In addition, margins have been maintained.
p239_194|Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.
p239_195|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p239_196|Two years of building a business will go up in smoke.
p239_197|You've got to be vigilant.
p239_198|He said the director had been completely friendly.
p239_199|Tiger is not the norm.
p239_200|It's been a humbling year.
p239_201|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p239_202|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
p239_203|It is all to do with the coaching.
p239_204|There was a fine line to tread.
p239_205|The refund is fully justified.
p239_206|My wife and family are the support system.
p239_207|We are now working with full-time on future product.
p239_208|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p239_209|He is a very talented player.
p239_210|Bottling is now the core business.
p239_211|I would be surprised if he decided to give up.
p239_212|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p239_213|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p239_214|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p239_215|That group reported just before Christmas.
p239_216|We had to add value.
p239_217|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p239_218|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p239_219|So I got a blood test.
p239_220|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
p239_221|I was caught out a little bit.
p239_222|There's always the next century.
p239_223|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
p239_224|But it's an enjoyable job.
p239_225|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
p239_226|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p239_227|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
p239_228|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p239_229|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
p239_230|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p239_231|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p239_232|It would seem a natural progression.
p239_233|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p239_234|We will turn the corner.
p239_235|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p239_236|My Dad is a hero.
p239_237|Jackie is passionate about Scotland.
p239_238|Further details are expected later.
p239_239|This is absolutely not true.
p239_240|They should stop the bombing.
p239_241|These days are long gone.
p239_242|And they were being paid ?
p239_243|was everything done to save people ?
p239_244|What was the matter for concern ?
p239_245|Do I think about them often ?
p239_246|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p239_247|I've learned from my mistakes.
p239_248|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p239_249|This season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment.
p239_250|I've come here for the jersey.
p239_251|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p239_252|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p239_253|The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.
p239_254|She replied, It could be.
p239_255|Allen is strong in every shape and form.
p239_256|Her political persuasion is no secret.
p239_257|We have a budget in March.
p239_258|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
p239_259|We have expanded too quickly.
p239_260|I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked.
p239_261|Boats and other equipment would be pooled.
p239_262|Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night.
p239_263|Our position remains the same.
p239_264|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p239_265|They could not match it.
p239_266|He is not a pathetic figure.
p239_267|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
p239_268|They made such decisions in London.
p239_269|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p239_270|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p239_271|Each case is treated on merit.
p239_272|A winter of discontent awaits.
p239_273|I thought we were fantastic.
p239_274|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p239_275|It's going to be very closely watched.
p239_276|It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.
p239_277|They receive a high profile in the media.
p239_278|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p239_279|Miller was every bit as happy.
p239_280|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
p239_281|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p239_282|There is no internal damage.
p239_283|We've had great things in the past.
p239_284|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p239_285|It has been recorded twice.
p239_286|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p239_287|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p239_288|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p239_289|This youngster is so exciting!
p239_290|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p239_291|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p239_292|They will probably come back.
p239_293|This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude.
p239_294|I saw them last week.
p239_295|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p239_296|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p239_297|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p239_298|We may need to take some very radical measures.
p239_299|Everyone can have their opinion.
p239_300|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
p239_301|Celtic are delaying the question of a new contract.
p239_302|Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached.
p239_303|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
p239_304|That should give me a chance.
p239_305|They have played their part.
p239_306|This will be our new beginning.
p239_307|They have the cash and the fire power.
p239_308|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p239_309|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p239_310|Racism has no place in any sport.
p239_311|Celtic were the losers then.
p239_312|What do we want to do that for ?
p239_313|Does the name matter ?
p239_314|how do you get it back ?
p239_315|What are you not good at ?
p239_316|I think, therefore I am ?
p239_317|Who was she ?
p239_318|The result is utterly compelling.
p239_319|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p239_320|I have been very nervous.
p239_321|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p239_322|There were also some interesting questions and answers.
p239_323|I won't make an official complaint.
p239_324|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
p239_325|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p239_326|They are looking at a flotation.
p239_327|They make a selective perception process.
p239_328|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p239_329|He was admitted to hospital.
p239_330|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p239_331|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p239_332|January is a bad time of year.
p239_333|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
p239_334|Royal Bank declined to comment.
p239_335|From there, they can go anywhere.
p239_336|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p239_337|Twaddle is a case in point.
p239_338|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p239_339|My daughter is an adult.
p239_340|It will affect their work.
p239_341|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
p239_342|I am considered a teenager.
p239_343|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p239_344|The FBI could become involved.
p239_345|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
p239_346|I just felt that I was broken down.
p239_347|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p239_348|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p239_349|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p239_350|Translation - we got it wrong.
p239_351|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p239_352|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
p239_353|What happened in that game ?
p239_354|Are you going to win ?
p239_355|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p239_356|So, did she meet him ?
p239_357|So what is the campaign about ?
p239_358|The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October.
p239_359|William Hague delighted his party.
p239_360|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
p239_361|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
p239_362|Walker plans to return indoors.
p239_363|The actual increases will be announced next month.
p239_364|The statement contained no surprises.
p239_365|The scientific debate is dead.
p239_366|This would include the GM food industry.
p239_367|But the rally was short-lived.
p239_368|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p239_369|They are the innocent victims.
p239_370|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p239_371|He ended up a headmaster.
p239_372|That took about two years.
p239_373|He is obviously very dangerous.
p239_374|That remains the unanswered question.
p239_375|This should come as no surprise.
p239_376|It was launched in February last year.
p239_377|Commitment is released on Liberty.
p239_378|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p239_379|He did not say that.
p239_380|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p239_381|We have not been approached.
p239_382|Murray Johnstone will replace it.
p239_383|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
p239_384|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p239_385|Those overseas offices were great.
p239_386|Well, that's just a third district.
p239_387|She asked for the appointment with me.
p239_388|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
p239_389|A new school will be built.
p239_390|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p239_391|How are you, sir ?
p239_392|So is that it, then ?
p239_393|Do I have a favourite ?
p239_394|His leader wanted to celebrate.
p239_395|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p239_396|This fact is supported by audience research.
p239_397|Because of that I didn't enjoy the game.
p239_398|We were beaten by the better team.
p239_399|Both sides have to step back.
p239_400|Analysts were impressed with progress made.
p239_401|Everything has its place and purpose.
p239_402|I have received no explanation.
p239_403|Turnover was highest in telecoms.
p239_404|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
p239_405|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p239_406|This game is very evenly balanced.
p239_407|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
p239_408|It seems a waste of talents.
p239_409|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p239_410|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p239_411|You can feel at home in China.
p239_412|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p239_413|We have no information on Iraq.
p239_414|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p239_415|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
p239_416|You're not getting any goodwill.
p239_417|The baby deserves the credit.
p239_418|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p239_419|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p239_420|I should think so, too.
p239_421|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p239_422|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p239_423|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p239_424|The capital costs are modest.
p239_425|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p239_426|It certainly feels that way.
p239_427|This idea has been around for four years.
p239_428|Or maybe it's the other way around.
p239_429|We are facing a health disaster if we do not act.
p239_430|We accept the new rules.
p239_431|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p239_432|They are interior designers and architects.
p239_433|He was released after treatment.
p239_434|All the pieces fit together perfectly.
p239_435|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p239_436|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
p239_437|Things are going to change over the next six months.
p239_438|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
p239_439|The potential for Scottish beef is not limited to carcasses.
p239_440|It is also very valuable.
p239_441|The stage was set for a showdown.
p239_442|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p239_443|They should not feel under threat.
p239_444|Any error is severely punished.
p239_445|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p239_446|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p239_447|Hard cash is needed now.
p239_448|Her housekeeper discovered the break-in on Thursday morning.
p239_449|Blair also had a penalty.
p239_450|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p239_451|Either way, it's very funny.
p239_452|We didn't want any trouble.
p239_453|It seemed a logical expansion.
p239_454|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p239_455|And Michael was just great.
p239_456|Now it has doubled in size.
p239_457|It was never a free kick.
p239_458|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p239_459|This is a great opportunity for us.
p239_460|Further savings would arise from common procurement and IT systems.
p239_461|Inventories are coming under control.
p239_462|She failed in her action.
p239_463|We will provide immediate access.
p239_464|We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives.
p239_465|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
p239_466|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p239_467|Dunfermline manager Jimmy Calderwood was candid.
p239_468|The money is within the total allocation.
p239_469|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p239_470|This does not create any precedent.
p239_471|There's nothing I can say.
p239_472|We need a visionary producer.
p239_473|The response from everyone was wonderful.
p239_474|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p239_475|I am sorry, but I forgot.
p239_476|Banking stocks were hit hard.
p239_477|We did something about it.
p239_478|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p239_479|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p239_480|Five years later, the deception continued.
p239_481|The rescue package is public money.
p239_482|The death toll included five children.
p239_483|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p240_001|Please call Stella.
p240_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p240_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p240_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p240_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p240_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p240_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p240_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p240_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p240_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p240_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p240_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p240_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p240_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p240_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p240_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p240_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p240_018|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p240_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p240_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p240_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p240_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p240_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p240_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p240_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p240_026|But it failed.
p240_027|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p240_028|Is this accurate?
p240_029|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p240_030|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p240_031|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p240_032|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p240_033|This is the window.
p240_034|People love to see this stuff.
p240_035|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p240_036|It is marvellous.
p240_037|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p240_038|It has failed.
p240_039|They're just different.
p240_040|It's a real threat.
p240_041|It was the eighties.
p240_042|Indeed, he does.
p240_043|President Bush is at war.
p240_044|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p240_045|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p240_046|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p240_047|It is so sad.
p240_048|That period was a struggle.
p240_049|This represents a tough game for us.
p240_050|Who can say?
p240_051|It's a blessing.
p240_052|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
p240_053|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p240_054|He is too weak to move.
p240_055|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p240_056|He had no enemies.
p240_057|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p240_058|However the drama was still not at an end.
p240_059|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p240_060|That's the truth.
p240_061|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p240_062|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p240_063|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
p240_064|Art is extra.
p240_065|Scotland had great assets.
p240_066|They are real.
p240_067|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p240_068|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p240_069|It should be devolved.
p240_070|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p240_071|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p240_072|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p240_073|I was as strong as a horse.
p240_074|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p240_075|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p240_076|She died in hospital two hours later.
p240_077|Is there a new way forward?
p240_078|I've got the shirt.
p240_079|Today she has been released.
p240_080|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p240_081|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p240_082|What has changed?
p240_083|He is in the queue.
p240_084|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p240_085|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p240_086|Someone who cares
p240_087|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p240_088|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p240_089|They lived for their children.
p240_090|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p240_091|Today I couldn't run on it.
p240_092|She told The Herald.
p240_093|We could not get any possession.
p240_094|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p240_095|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p240_096|They were outside the circle.
p240_097|He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days.
p240_098|It was a good performance.
p240_099|I see no need for change.
p240_100|We have every respect for Michelle.
p240_101|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p240_102|He takes the job.
p240_103|They will want to perform well.
p240_104|That all hope is never lost.
p240_105|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p240_106|Getting new people interested in this music is the real reward.
p240_107|It's in his blood.
p240_108|It's a shame.
p240_109|It had been played at festivals.
p240_110|I came to complete.
p240_111|It's a question of perception.
p240_112|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p240_113|This film will be totally awesome.
p240_114|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p240_115|I'm delighted about that.
p240_116|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p240_117|I joined a group.
p240_118|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p240_119|She really suffered for her art.
p240_120|It is a delight on every level.
p240_121|You can spend money on housing.
p240_122|There were no grounds for his action.
p240_123|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p240_124|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p240_125|I was furious.
p240_126|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p240_127|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p240_128|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p240_129|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p240_130|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p240_131|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p240_132|It was the same at Twickenham.
p240_133|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p240_134|It is also well received.
p240_135|Government will intervene.
p240_136|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p240_137|He was in a great deal of pain.
p240_138|We want to keep the pound.
p240_139|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p240_140|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p240_141|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p240_142|Who would be right?
p240_143|She died at her home.
p240_144|I am just trying to do my job.
p240_145|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p240_146|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p240_147|They did very well.
p240_148|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p240_149|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p240_150|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
p240_151|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p240_152|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p240_153|Mr Blair had done well.
p240_154|I was in daily contact.
p240_155|My Dad is a hero.
p240_156|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p240_157|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p240_158|Was this element always there?
p240_159|These days are long gone.
p240_160|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p240_161|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p240_162|I was in the train station overnight.
p240_163|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p240_164|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p240_165|Tell it like it was?
p240_166|We have a budget in March.
p240_167|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p240_168|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p240_169|They will do their own thing.
p240_170|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p240_171|It's quite a routine.
p240_172|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p240_173|The hotel was now for sale.
p240_174|I drove the ball well.
p240_175|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p240_176|They know no other way.
p240_177|There is no point in looking any further.
p240_178|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p240_179|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p240_180|They will run a mile.
p240_181|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p240_182|They need to look after themselves.
p240_183|Miller was every bit as happy.
p240_184|What has caused the demise of singing?
p240_185|We want to help them through it.
p240_186|They really did a great job.
p240_187|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p240_188|It is tough, but possible.
p240_189|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p240_190|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p240_191|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p240_192|People will ask about us.
p240_193|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p240_194|It is a farce.
p240_195|I am totally surprised.
p240_196|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p240_197|It wasn't to be.
p240_198|There was no option.
p240_199|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p240_200|But we are not immune to the problem.
p240_201|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p240_202|Who will pay for this?
p240_203|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p240_204|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p240_205|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p240_206|It's all about money, money, money.
p240_207|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p240_208|It's a mixture of everything.
p240_209|We have an election in eight days.
p240_210|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p240_211|We'll have to work hard today.
p240_212|She should not be blamed.
p240_213|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p240_214|It had all been arranged.
p240_215|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p240_216|His third goal was superb.
p240_217|I was so nervous.
p240_218|Work has started.
p240_219|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p240_220|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p240_221|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p240_222|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p240_223|That has been the easy part.
p240_224|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p240_225|But it will be sorted out this week.
p240_226|What was the main difference?
p240_227|I am immensely sad.
p240_228|It is a gamble.
p240_229|At the time, he was a living legend.
p240_230|It's so special.
p240_231|They are the innocent victims.
p240_232|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p240_233|The body follows the mind.
p240_234|However, no further action was taken by police.
p240_235|And thought we would get away with it.
p240_236|Jobs could go.
p240_237|It is not the message alone.
p240_238|It's quite a line-up!
p240_239|It's very safe.
p240_240|But it's a subtle process.
p240_241|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p240_242|He was good, but not that good.
p240_243|We were extremely poor.
p240_244|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p240_245|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p240_246|It is hard won.
p240_247|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p240_248|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p240_249|I am the opposite because I haven't played very much.
p240_250|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p240_251|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p240_252|He got the same story.
p240_253|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p240_254|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
p240_255|A friendship that will endure.
p240_256|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p240_257|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p240_258|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p240_259|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p240_260|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p240_261|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p240_262|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p240_263|I was happily surprised.
p240_264|They must play for each other.
p240_265|It is also very valuable.
p240_266|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p240_267|Blood samples were taken.
p240_268|There is no link.
p240_269|This is a question of Islam.
p240_270|It looks as though he will be right.
p240_271|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p240_272|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p240_273|Have a look at our accounts.
p240_274|He was also married with two children.
p240_275|And Michael was just great.
p240_276|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p240_277|Access has been a nightmare.
p240_278|It has been achieved by hard work and careful planning.
p240_279|It's a way of life.
p240_280|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p240_281|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p240_282|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p240_283|People have no choice.
p240_284|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p240_285|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p240_286|If not, he should go home.
p240_288|His mother refuses to believe that she is dead.
p240_289|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p240_290|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p240_291|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p240_292|He will address the nation this evening.
p240_293|It was a virus.
p240_294|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p240_295|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p240_296|It's like a high school play.
p240_297|Who did the recruiting?
p240_298|He was obviously very genuine.
p240_299|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p240_300|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p240_301|A new school will be built.
p240_302|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p240_303|He said she was mad.
p240_304|I was the sheep.
p240_305|There was no hint of scandal.
p240_306|The home was now under new management.
p240_307|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p240_308|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p240_309|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p240_310|We do not expect any surplus.
p240_311|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p240_312|The plot is minimal.
p240_313|And he goes with it.
p240_314|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p240_315|It is no surprise.
p240_316|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p240_317|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p240_318|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p240_319|They were fantastic.
p240_320|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p240_321|We are a peaceful people.
p240_322|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p240_323|Henman has been warned.
p240_324|Craig is a major concern for us.
p240_325|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p240_326|It is out there.
p240_327|Referees are easy targets.
p240_328|They had a confession.
p240_329|We do the same.
p240_330|That's the law of the land.
p240_331|Donald was his friend.
p240_332|I am so upset.
p240_333|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p240_334|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p240_335|The police have to act to help them.
p240_336|We agreed to disagree.
p240_337|It could have gone either way.
p240_338|He was then replaced by Ross.
p240_339|I saw some good things.
p240_340|I've not thought about it.
p240_341|Who was the mystery MP?
p240_342|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p240_343|It is a sign of hope.
p240_344|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p240_345|Three years ago he would have been.
p240_346|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p240_347|It is so unfair.
p240_348|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p240_349|He has to learn.
p240_351|Look at the witnesses.
p240_352|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p240_353|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p240_354|The composer will conduct.
p240_355|This is a friendly match?
p240_357|They should take their mobile phones.
p240_358|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p240_359|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p240_360|He had played well in that central role.
p241_001|Please call Stella.
p241_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p241_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p241_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p241_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p241_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p241_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p241_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p241_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p241_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p241_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p241_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p241_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p241_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p241_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p241_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p241_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p241_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p241_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p241_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p241_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p241_025|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p241_026|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p241_027|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p241_028|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p241_029|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p241_030|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p241_031|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p241_032|This is the window.
p241_033|People love to see this stuff.
p241_034|And we have a singer.
p241_035|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p241_036|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p241_037|It's nice to hear.
p241_038|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p241_039|It is not for any other purpose.
p241_040|President Bush is at war.
p241_041|It was ugly.
p241_042|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p241_043|That period was a struggle.
p241_044|This represents a tough game for us.
p241_045|We need to chat.
p241_046|That time has passed.
p241_047|As she explains.
p241_048|He is too weak to move.
p241_049|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p241_050|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p241_051|He looks like an Afghan.
p241_052|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p241_053|However the drama was still not at an end.
p241_055|Next league matches Celtic.
p241_056|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p241_057|What was the main difference?
p241_058|I was an athlete.
p241_059|There was a battle there.
p241_061|It was all in a short period of time.
p241_062|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p241_063|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p241_064|The script was funny.
p241_065|He could make it.
p241_066|Try to save us.
p241_067|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p241_068|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p241_069|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p241_070|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p241_071|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p241_072|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p241_073|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p241_074|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p241_075|It is a job creation scheme.
p241_076|He is now resident in England.
p241_077|Even the one she loved.
p241_078|I've got the shirt.
p241_079|This is the way things should be handled.
p241_080|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p241_081|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p241_082|I first met him last summer.
p241_083|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p241_084|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p241_085|Someone who cares
p241_087|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p241_088|And rugby fans can help.
p241_089|They have not done so this season so far.
p241_090|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p241_091|Now the system is right behind us.
p241_092|Today I couldn't run on it.
p241_093|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
p241_094|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p241_095|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p241_096|The peace process will be buried!
p241_098|I love the Dome.
p241_099|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p241_100|It was mayhem.
p241_101|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p241_102|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p241_103|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p241_104|They will want to perform well.
p241_105|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p241_106|I'm not depressed.
p241_107|It was his job to check.
p241_108|Is that right?
p241_109|You had better believe it.
p241_110|We want to help them through it.
p241_111|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p241_112|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p241_113|It's not fair.
p241_114|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.

p241_116|I'm delighted about that.

p241_120|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p241_121|You can spend money on housing.
p241_122|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p241_123|I'm so angry.
p241_124|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p241_125|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p241_126|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p241_127|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p241_128|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p241_129|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p241_130|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p241_132|What will happen then?
p241_133|It's not true.
p241_134|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p241_135|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p241_136|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p241_137|It was typical.
p241_138|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p241_139|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p241_140|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p241_141|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p241_142|He is severe.
p241_143|Is that Titanic?
p241_144|That group reported just before Christmas.
p241_145|I am just trying to do my job.
p241_146|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p241_147|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p241_148|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p241_149|We want to see the maximum of change.
p241_150|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p241_151|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p241_152|They were later discharged from hospital.
p241_153|Neither side can win this war.
p241_154|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p241_155|Was this element always there?
p241_157|It was so new, so exciting.
p241_158|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p241_159|I've put my own money into this project.
p241_160|We do not get that impression now.
p241_161|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p241_162|We have to move forward.
p241_163|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p241_164|We have a budget in March.
p241_165|There was no respite.
p241_166|They will do their own thing.
p241_167|The post will be unpaid.
p241_168|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p241_169|It is too much for me.
p241_170|He was a crazy man.
p241_171|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p241_172|It became a book by itself.
p241_173|One season, they might do well.
p241_174|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p241_175|And I saw the light!
p241_176|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p241_177|The clarity is vital.
p241_178|I drove the ball well.
p241_179|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p241_180|They know no other way.
p241_181|It is minute.
p241_182|They will run a mile.
p241_183|Four policemen were wounded.
p241_184|We did everything by the book.
p241_185|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p241_186|What has caused the demise of singing?
p241_187|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p241_188|I wish I could say something.
p241_189|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p241_190|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p241_191|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p241_192|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p241_193|Off I went.
p241_195|It's the same old story.
p241_196|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p241_197|Is that success?
p241_198|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p241_199|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p241_200|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p241_202|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p241_203|He's not perfect.
p241_204|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p241_205|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p241_206|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p241_207|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p241_208|I don't want to use it.
p241_209|But I am a worried man.
p241_210|He knows a lot.
p241_211|It had all been arranged.
p241_212|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p241_213|His third goal was superb.
p241_214|It's been a good year.
p241_215|We want to keep the pound.
p241_216|I was so nervous.
p241_217|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p241_218|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p241_219|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p241_220|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p241_221|You have to do your research.
p241_222|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p241_223|We played them off the pitch.
p241_224|But it will be sorted out this week.
p241_225|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p241_226|My neighbours are horrified.
p241_227|The track is currently covered in snow.
p241_228|Who would be right?
p241_229|It is set in Paris.
p241_230|It is not the message alone.
p241_231|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p241_232|Hospitals are for the ill.
p241_233|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p241_234|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p241_235|We were extremely poor.
p241_236|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p241_237|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
p241_238|It is hard won.
p241_239|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p241_240|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p241_241|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p241_242|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p241_243|The scene is about this?
p241_244|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p241_245|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p241_246|They are different types.
p241_247|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p241_248|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p241_249|This is the culture change in medicine.
p241_250|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p241_251|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p241_252|Special measures were needed.
p241_253|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p241_254|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p241_255|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p241_256|They are real.
p241_257|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p241_258|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p241_259|That's the only thing I will say.
p241_260|It was good fun.
p241_261|It looks as though he will be right.
p241_262|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p241_264|Immediate action must be taken.
p241_265|It's very nice.
p241_266|It left me with a sadness.
p241_267|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p241_268|And Michael was just great.
p241_269|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p241_270|Access has been a nightmare.
p241_271|But he is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p241_272|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p241_273|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p241_274|It was a privilege to work for him.
p241_275|It's so awful.
p241_276|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p241_277|We are a grandmother.
p241_278|We have to break that cycle.
p241_279|I saw it at a ruck.
p241_280|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p241_281|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p241_282|Yet, it worked.
p241_283|I should think so, too.
p241_284|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p241_285|The death toll included five children.
p241_286|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p241_287|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p241_288|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p241_289|It changed my life.
p241_290|A new school will be built.
p241_291|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p241_292|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p241_293|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p241_294|What has altered?
p241_295|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p241_296|It just came into my head that day.
p241_297|Our task is to complete the picture.
p241_298|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p241_299|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p241_300|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p241_301|This is a war over our home.
p241_302|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p241_303|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p241_304|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p241_305|And he goes with it.
p241_306|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p241_307|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p241_308|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p241_309|Is there on his hands?
p241_310|It was a question of patience.
p241_311|I was rubbish.
p241_312|Kids are terrible.
p241_313|It should be equal.
p241_314|Craig is a major concern for us.
p241_315|The home team had an amazing start.
p241_317|It is out there.
p241_319|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p241_320|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p241_321|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p241_322|It is a strong case.
p241_323|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p241_324|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p241_325|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
p241_326|We agreed to disagree.
p241_327|I'd like to take the plunge.
p241_328|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
p241_329|I've not thought about it.
p241_330|Who was the mystery MP?
p241_331|It's been hard.
p241_332|They should stop the bombing.
p241_333|Who will do it?
p241_334|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p241_336|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p241_337|I must make that clear.
p241_338|The train was on time.
p241_340|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p241_342|I would miss him.
p241_343|Tiger is the exception.
p241_344|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p241_345|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p241_346|His contract was then not renewed.
p241_347|I got a yellow card.
p241_349|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p241_350|There is a cup final at stake.
p241_351|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p243_001|Please call Stella.
p243_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p243_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p243_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p243_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p243_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p243_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p243_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p243_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p243_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p243_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p243_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p243_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p243_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p243_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p243_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p243_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p243_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p243_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p243_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p243_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p243_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p243_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p243_025|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
p243_026|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
p243_027|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
p243_028|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
p243_029|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
p243_030|She brought a lot to my life.
p243_031|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
p243_032|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
p243_033|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
p243_034|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
p243_035|It is about control of our economy.
p243_036|Each brand was owned by a different family.
p243_037|That was not perfect golf by any means.
p243_038|He added that her comments were noted.
p243_039|She will get through it I'm sure.
p243_040|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p243_041|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
p243_042|He does not even trust his own members.
p243_043|He too started on the subs seats.
p243_044|Is it worth it ?
p243_045|Does it matter ?
p243_046|How do you take them away ?
p243_047|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p243_048|After the match, do you ?
p243_049|Has the conflict started ?
p243_050|Have I really come to this ?
p243_051|I'm as fit as I can get.
p243_052|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
p243_053|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
p243_054|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
p243_055|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
p243_056|They seem too much of a sure thing.
p243_057|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p243_058|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p243_059|We just want this season to end.
p243_060|It was a day she thought she would never see.
p243_061|Talks have continued at many different levels.
p243_062|The referee is there to decide these things.
p243_063|There were no details of the other five victims.
p243_064|It also has a good labour supply.
p243_065|Indeed he has a lot of output.
p243_066|Do not give your details to anyone.
p243_067|He was failed by his health authority.
p243_068|But it was not all bad news.
p243_069|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
p243_070|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
p243_071|It turned me against the whole system.
p243_072|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
p243_073|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
p243_074|But two groups refused to sign up.
p243_075|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
p243_076|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p243_077|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
p243_078|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p243_079|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
p243_080|They said our costs were too high.
p243_081|I do not attempt to answer that.
p243_082|It's been a great evening for us.
p243_083|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p243_084|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
p243_085|No plan for projects are yet in place.
p243_086|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
p243_087|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
p243_088|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p243_089|I feel I did not have enough time.
p243_090|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p243_091|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p243_092|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
p243_093|They had the appeal of TV stars.
p243_094|There is no issue of national security involved here.
p243_095|He will be a very hard act to follow.
p243_096|Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p243_097|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p243_098|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
p243_099|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
p243_100|I am delighted to hear this news.
p243_101|We are already seeing some positive results.
p243_102|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
p243_103|We were under a bit of pressure.
p243_104|They won't actually make any money from it.
p243_105|I bought a flat six years ago.
p243_106|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p243_107|They are a different team at home.
p243_108|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
p243_109|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
p243_110|Some young girls also came by last night.
p243_111|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
p243_112|What are they for ?
p243_113|Is there a waiting list ?
p243_114|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p243_115|So what happens next ?
p243_116|Had this been common practice ?
p243_117|What do they want us to do ?
p243_118|The idea is the shop within a shop.
p243_119|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
p243_120|It is the right package for Scotland.
p243_121|They have no real friends in the region.
p243_122|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p243_123|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p243_125|I think there's not much between them.
p243_126|So I am going in the right direction.
p243_127|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p243_128|We have to offer value for money.
p243_129|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
p243_130|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
p243_131|He's got to look after himself now.
p243_132|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
p243_133|No country has a similar training programme.
p243_134|There is no future in rock music.
p243_135|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
p243_136|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
p243_137|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
p243_138|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
p243_139|The programme has been made with great care.
p243_140|There was only one living room, you see.
p243_141|I am not under any new pressure.
p243_142|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p243_143|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
p243_144|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
p243_145|All eight victims were based in Germany.
p243_146|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
p243_147|You should feel involved in their lives.
p243_148|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p243_149|Is it in the right place ?
p243_150|Did he trip ?
p243_151|Does that put pressure on us ?
p243_152|Did it work ?
p243_153|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p243_154|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
p243_155|Time may already have run out for this option.
p243_156|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
p243_157|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
p243_158|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
p243_159|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
p243_160|A progress report will be published in October.
p243_161|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
p243_162|That will reduce my chance of selection.
p243_163|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
p243_164|Surely it can't run for two years.
p243_165|But the game is still wide open.
p243_166|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
p243_167|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
p243_168|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
p243_169|We had to work very hard for our points.
p243_170|That is a big risk at any price.
p243_171|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p243_172|He said some things which were better left alone.
p243_173|If successful, several records will be made.
p243_174|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
p243_175|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p243_176|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
p243_177|It's just a different way of life.
p243_178|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p243_179|Nato has left them with no other option.
p243_180|I am secure in my own position.
p243_181|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
p243_182|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p243_183|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
p243_184|We have come a long way since then.
p243_185|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p243_186|A great player has to win major championships.
p243_187|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
p243_188|I didn't miss the big house at all.
p243_189|The story was not made public by this club.
p243_190|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
p243_191|You are not long home from work.
p243_192|I am fighting the force of nature.
p243_193|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p243_194|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
p243_195|And they were being paid ?
p243_196|was everything done to save people ?
p243_197|What was the matter for concern ?
p243_198|But they had to be paid for.
p243_199|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
p243_200|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
p243_201|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
p243_202|I've never had a year like this.
p243_203|Full details are expected to be released in June.
p243_204|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
p243_205|Hague will be leader at the election after next.
p243_206|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p243_207|I want an answer from the British Government.
p243_208|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
p243_209|They are a victim of their own success.
p243_210|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p243_211|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
p243_212|It is going to change the world.
p243_213|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
p243_214|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
p243_215|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
p243_216|I am not going to judge them.
p243_217|I do not see this so much as failure.
p243_218|A European final must be the millennium target.
p243_219|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p243_220|I was independent but I am not now.
p243_221|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
p243_222|We are still seeking that complete performance.
p243_223|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
p243_224|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
p243_225|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
p243_226|If not, a deal could take many months.
p243_227|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
p243_228|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
p243_229|I want to see as much progress as possible.
p243_230|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
p243_231|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
p243_232|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
p243_233|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
p243_234|The labour side has developed in the North area.
p243_235|You are not allowed to do that.
p243_236|That is the last thing they need.
p243_237|He has worked for several years in the United States.
p243_238|The children were later able to leave by bus.
p243_239|Jim was down there with his wife.
p243_240|Was it the wife ?
p243_241|Why change it ?
p243_242|What do we want to do that for ?
p243_243|Does the name matter ?
p243_244|how do you get it back ?
p243_245|What are you not good at ?
p243_246|I think, therefore I am ?
p243_247|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
p243_248|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
p243_249|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
p243_250|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p243_251|However, the figures tell a different story.
p243_252|The rise has come too late for some.
p243_253|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
p243_254|I'd rather play well next week than here.
p243_255|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
p243_256|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
p243_257|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
p243_258|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
p243_259|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
p243_260|And they never show the same film as a rival.
p243_261|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
p243_262|There would be a north and south division.
p243_263|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
p243_264|The two companies were not for sale.
p243_265|His condition was described as serious last night.
p243_266|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p243_267|The board do not own the company.
p243_268|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
p243_269|They always want to give a performance.
p243_270|Its primary business channel is the internet.
p243_271|That's been the difference between the sides.
p243_272|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
p243_273|I think I was about four years old.
p243_274|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
p243_275|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
p243_276|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
p243_277|I think the shares are good value.
p243_278|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p243_279|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
p243_280|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
p243_281|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
p243_282|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
p243_283|He may be ready for first team action in March.
p243_284|The fans pay for their season tickets.
p243_286|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
p243_287|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p243_288|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
p243_289|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
p243_290|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
p243_291|He would get into any world team.
p243_292|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
p243_293|They first met during a Step in London.
p243_294|The agreement remains the only show in town.
p243_295|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p243_296|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p243_297|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p243_298|It is based on population rather than need.
p243_299|He could understand both points of view.
p243_300|So, did she meet him ?
p243_301|So what is the campaign about ?
p243_302|And does it ?
p243_303|Are you from the rugby ?
p243_304|Had I heard ?
p243_305|What happened in that game ?
p243_306|Are you going to win ?
p243_308|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
p243_309|It happened on average once a week this year.
p243_310|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p243_311|He is keen to stay in public service.
p243_312|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
p243_313|For that reason cover should not be given.
p243_314|He felt too close to head office.
p243_315|If you believe in the blue and white.
p243_316|A report on their property is due within days.
p243_317|He will just go on doing his job.
p243_318|I always felt they played for me.
p243_319|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p243_320|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
p243_321|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
p243_322|We will not simply hit these people.
p243_323|We still think this trade is on the increase.
p243_324|It is not either national standards or local control.
p243_325|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
p243_326|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
p243_327|I try to be open to experience.
p243_328|He is not exactly a pretty child.
p243_329|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
p243_330|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p243_331|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
p243_332|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
p243_333|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
p243_334|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
p243_335|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
p243_336|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
p243_337|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p243_338|How are you, sir ?
p243_339|So is that it, then ?
p243_340|Do I have a favourite ?
p243_341|Put another way, they just won't do it.
p243_342|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
p243_343|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
p243_344|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
p243_345|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
p243_346|It was a bit like having children.
p243_347|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
p243_348|And that is the bottom line - box office.
p243_349|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
p243_350|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
p243_352|Sales will begin by the end of October.
p243_353|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
p243_354|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p243_355|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
p243_356|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
p243_357|It is the only natural British site on the list.
p243_358|His style was direct and very human.
p243_359|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
p243_360|They have the cash and the fire power.
p243_361|The institute board will take the decision.
p243_362|He's young enough and he must learn.
p243_363|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
p243_364|Both players gave so much to the side.
p243_365|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p243_366|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p243_367|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
p243_368|It was a goal which came from nothing.
p243_369|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
p243_370|I have come here to show support for the families.
p243_371|We have been going for three years.
p243_372|He really played us into a corner.
p243_373|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
p243_374|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
p243_375|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
p243_376|It used to be all hard sell.
p243_377|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
p243_378|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
p244_001|Please call Stella.
p244_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p244_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p244_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p244_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p244_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p244_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p244_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p244_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p244_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p244_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p244_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p244_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p244_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p244_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p244_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p244_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p244_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p244_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p244_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p244_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p244_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p244_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p244_025|We are a service industry.
p244_026|It may be good for the soul.
p244_027|We want to lift the cup for the fans.
p244_028|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p244_029|It is about investing in the future.
p244_030|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p244_031|They were in good humour, too.
p244_032|The end result is the same.
p244_033|It is on the internet.
p244_034|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p244_035|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p244_036|This is a central issue.
p244_037|History is in the making.
p244_038|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p244_039|She was there for the start of the campaign.
p244_040|She was at the top.
p244_041|In London today, it was business as usual.
p244_042|And they had a case.
p244_043|Something has to be put in place.
p244_044|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p244_045|They are going after them.
p244_046|It is all about the story.
p244_047|The whole thing is the music.
p244_048|In fact, they are the future of investment.
p244_049|That is still the case.
p244_050|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p244_051|In my view, it has to be done.
p244_052|The pressure on the players will build.
p244_053|Their campaign is in disarray.
p244_054|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p244_055|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p244_056|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p244_057|Clearly, they had other problems.
p244_058|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p244_059|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p244_060|We have got to deliver.
p244_061|That was the difference today.
p244_062|The company continues to grow.
p244_063|He said it was for sale.
p244_064|We felt it was sufficient.
p244_065|That is all in the past.
p244_066|There is a lot to be done.
p244_067|But that's another story for another day.
p244_068|He has not been dropped.
p244_069|It was an outstanding performance.
p244_070|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p244_071|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p244_072|It is only the beginning.
p244_073|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p244_074|Only water is currently allowed.
p244_075|This time, it might be for real.
p244_076|She did that for the rest of her life.
p244_077|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p244_078|That will be the office.
p244_079|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p244_080|How are you, sir ?
p244_081|So is that it, then ?
p244_082|Do I have a favourite ?
p244_083|What do we do ?
p244_084|Why do it otherwise ?
p244_085|It starts with the script.
p244_086|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p244_087|It would have been around the turn of the century.
p244_088|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p244_089|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p244_090|It seems a good thing to try.
p244_091|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p244_092|It sounds a lot of money.
p244_093|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p244_094|It is not a story.
p244_095|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p244_096|He is in the US.
p244_097|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p244_098|It took an option on the process.
p244_099|By then, he was walking on water.
p244_100|This is a game of confidence.
p244_101|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p244_102|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
p244_103|The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.
p244_104|The trick is to try it.
p244_105|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p244_106|Victory was never in doubt.
p244_107|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p244_108|On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.
p244_109|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p244_110|Then again, we could have.
p244_111|There, you were just a body.
p244_112|But he has not become a monster.
p244_113|He is not a dancer.
p244_114|We had planned to sell the property for some time.
p244_115|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p244_116|In the end we have to take a stand.
p244_117|This is a sea change in approach.
p244_118|Otherwise, the market may come back.
p244_119|The procedures were not in place.
p244_120|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p244_121|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
p244_122|He was not alone at the top of the board.
p244_123|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
p244_124|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p244_125|We had a great time.
p244_126|I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.
p244_127|According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p244_128|It was far from business as usual.
p244_129|He wanted to record the group.
p244_130|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p244_131|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p244_132|It is hard to believe.
p244_133|Or it would have been.
p244_134|Three days later, he was killed.
p244_135|Football is a passion for many.
p244_136|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p244_137|So, did she meet him ?
p244_138|So what is the campaign about ?
p244_139|And does it ?
p244_140|Are you from the rugby ?
p244_141|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
p244_142|That was the first step.
p244_143|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
p244_144|I have been in contact with him.
p244_145|Actors like to be in the centre.
p244_146|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
p244_147|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p244_148|I am the manager of Scotland.
p244_149|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p244_150|There were no grounds for his action.
p244_151|I can't even get into the A team.
p244_152|It starts at the top.
p244_153|Others are expected to follow the lead.
p244_154|She does not want to speak.
p244_155|It was all for good reason as well.
p244_156|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p244_157|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p244_158|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p244_159|If not, a deal could take many months.
p244_160|We want to get there.
p244_161|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p244_162|There is a lack of staff.
p244_163|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
p244_164|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p244_165|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p244_166|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
p244_167|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
p244_168|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p244_169|Anyone can do the sums.
p244_170|We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.
p244_171|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
p244_172|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
p244_173|We were all over the place in the first half.
p244_174|Like the others, he was arrested.
p244_175|All the pressure was on him.
p244_176|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p244_177|They have not been named.
p244_178|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
p244_179|I think the Labour party is completely split on this.
p244_180|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p244_181|I was always in control.
p244_182|It was by the numbers.
p244_183|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p244_184|It should never have happened.
p244_185|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p244_186|The feeling is hard to describe.
p244_187|It is difficult to say.
p244_188|That is a question for the next manager.
p244_189|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p244_190|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p244_191|It is simply not true.
p244_192|Are you going to win ?
p244_193|Was it the wife ?
p244_194|Why change it ?
p244_195|What do we want to do that for ?
p244_196|Does the name matter ?
p244_197|That you can do it.
p244_198|I would like to continue to develop.
p244_199|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p244_200|He has defended the system.
p244_201|We want to begin a programme in the UK.
p244_203|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p244_204|It is not an issue.
p244_205|They have to get that sorted.
p244_206|We can take the city.
p244_207|He played it like a veteran.
p244_208|It was the story of the second half.
p244_209|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
p244_210|As many as the market will support.
p244_211|He is believed to live in Britain.
p244_212|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
p244_213|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
p244_214|This conference was never confirmed.
p244_215|A team is a team.
p244_216|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p244_217|I'm interested in interesting work.
p244_218|It decided to blame the media.
p244_219|THE force is with them.
p244_220|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p244_221|It was important to win today.
p244_222|He was not injured in the attack.
p244_223|Because he was born in England.
p244_224|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p244_225|Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.
p244_226|I was not overly concerned about this.
p244_227|However, it is not as simple as this.
p244_228|We want this place to work.
p244_229|It still has an effect.
p244_230|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p244_231|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p244_232|Other villages were completely deserted.
p244_233|There is a lot of concern.
p244_234|It will be decided in the next month.
p244_235|We have to win the group.
p244_236|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p244_237|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p244_238|We have an election in eight days.
p244_239|There was a lot of resentment.
p244_240|This is a fight to the death.
p244_241|All will be revealed in due course.
p244_242|He is a man of the people.
p244_243|The matter is under appeal.
p244_244|And they were being paid ?
p244_245|was everything done to save people ?
p244_246|What was the matter for concern ?
p244_247|Do I think about them often ?
p244_248|Is it in the right place ?
p244_249|Did he trip ?
p244_250|Sadly, it could not be done.
p244_251|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p244_252|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p244_253|Instead, he missed the lot.
p244_254|I was never in danger.
p244_255|A lot has been written.
p244_256|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p244_257|It was really good in the first week.
p244_258|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p244_259|However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.
p244_260|That is not the case in Europe.
p244_261|But it was a loss.
p244_262|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p244_263|The performance continues to improve.
p244_264|It expected this trend to continue.
p244_265|However, no further action was taken by police.
p244_266|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p244_267|But we were in control at that point.
p244_268|It has to be enforced.
p244_269|The party has never fully recovered.
p244_270|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
p244_271|But the government has so far failed to listen.
p244_272|He must have a crack at it.
p244_273|I am still waiting for a reply.
p244_274|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p244_275|He was good, but not that good.
p244_276|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
p244_277|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p244_278|However, the matter is not going to end there.
p244_279|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p244_280|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p244_281|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
p244_282|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
p244_283|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
p244_284|It is important that he is involved.
p244_285|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p244_286|It should be noted that he has been released without charge.
p244_287|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p244_288|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p244_290|I should think so, too.
p244_291|None of the agencies was able to help.
p244_292|I didn't see the point.
p244_293|This idea has been around for four years.
p244_294|We are in a war.
p244_295|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p244_296|Is our children learning ?
p244_297|How independent is that ?
p244_298|What form did that take ?
p244_299|Are they free ?
p244_300|Scotland won by six wickets.
p244_301|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p244_302|This is a historic agreement.
p244_303|We have to be realistic.
p244_304|Every one is a winner.
p244_305|There was a hole in it.
p244_306|It will be done in stages.
p244_307|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
p244_308|Every character was completely different.
p244_309|But it is a similar problem.
p244_310|In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.
p244_311|But it is important for a number of reasons.
p244_312|In that moment, I was happy.
p244_313|All of the management has invested in the firm.
p244_314|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p244_315|They were not at the property yesterday.
p244_316|It involved the same people.
p244_317|We want to get back into the Champions League.
p244_318|We have to be very, very careful.
p244_319|Look at the potential of this club.
p244_320|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p244_321|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p244_322|We did something about it.
p244_323|But it is up again.
p244_324|However, the devil is in the detail.
p244_325|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
p244_326|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
p244_327|He is already in place.
p244_328|Another difference is the cost.
p244_329|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
p244_330|And we can do it.
p244_331|What are they for ?
p244_333|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p244_334|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p244_335|And it's a goodbye from him.
p244_336|It is a sensitive issue.
p244_337|They have to be addressed.
p244_338|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p244_339|Like many companies, it is a problem.
p244_340|The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.
p244_341|However, a bid was never made.
p244_342|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
p244_343|Something is going to have to give.
p244_344|And the context is also completely different.
p244_345|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p244_346|The banking sector was weak.
p244_347|But the New Year was special.
p244_348|We never played at all.
p244_349|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p244_350|This isn't the end of story.
p244_351|He is a great prospect.
p244_352|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
p244_353|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p244_354|Of course, it does not have to be this way.
p244_355|This latter suggestion is very important.
p244_356|However, it does not tell the full story.
p244_357|They were impressive against France.
p244_358|The challenge is to win a cup.
p244_359|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p244_360|It was a test in itself.
p244_361|Either team will be hard.
p244_362|The parents will have a great time, too.
p244_363|At first, the youngster was not keen.
p244_364|However, it has to be seen as part of a package.
p244_365|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p244_366|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
p244_367|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p244_368|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p244_369|However, it was well worth the wait.
p244_370|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p244_371|I have a good feeling about this.
p244_372|The news is not all bad.
p244_373|Some of the passing was a disgrace.
p244_374|However, it does not seem to be the case.
p244_375|It is almost certain to be the last.
p244_376|You have to be patient.
p244_377|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p244_378|I was delighted to accept.
p244_379|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p244_380|We are not going to fight in Kosovo.
p244_381|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p244_382|It's fantastic to win again.
p244_383|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
p244_384|The company won the first round but lost on appeal.
p244_385|Everything is in the mix.
p244_386|An announcement is expected this week.
p244_387|He will be difficult to replace.
p244_388|I would be interested in another attempt.
p244_389|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p244_390|He was on a mission.
p244_391|Does it matter ?
p244_392|How do you take them away ?
p244_393|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p244_394|After the match, do you ?
p244_395|One-third of the places are already taken.
p244_396|I understand the frustration of the fans.
p244_397|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p244_398|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p244_399|I want this one to be different.
p244_400|It is the last meeting of the season.
p244_401|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p244_402|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p244_403|He is a quality player.
p244_404|The service is expected to be introduced in December.
p245_001|Please call Stella.
p245_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p245_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p245_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p245_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p245_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p245_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p245_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p245_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p245_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p245_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p245_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p245_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p245_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p245_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p245_016|Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p245_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p245_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p245_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p245_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p245_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p245_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p245_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p245_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p245_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p245_026|But it failed.
p245_027|It's nice to hear.
p245_028|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p245_029|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p245_030|They should be so lucky.
p245_031|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p245_032|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p245_033|I was an athlete.
p245_034|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p245_035|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p245_036|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p245_037|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p245_038|It has failed.
p245_039|It was clear.
p245_040|It's a great thing.
p245_041|Indeed, he does.
p245_042|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p245_043|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p245_044|But it took a lot of bottle.
p245_045|Sure, it's funny.
p245_046|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p245_047|This represents a tough game for us.
p245_048|We need to chat.
p245_049|The boy is no longer with us.
p245_050|Who can say?
p245_051|It's a blessing.
p245_053|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p245_054|They had to explain it.
p245_055|He had no enemies.
p245_056|Sadly, it can't.
p245_057|None has ever been found.
p245_058|It's a matter of balance.
p245_059|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p245_060|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p245_061|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p245_062|He should have asked for a second opinion.
p245_063|He was popular.
p245_064|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p245_065|The script was funny.
p245_066|You need a trademark.
p245_067|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p245_068|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p245_069|She died in hospital two hours later.
p245_070|Is there a new way forward?
p245_071|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p245_072|People must remain vigilant.
p245_073|This is the way things should be handled.
p245_074|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p245_075|What has changed?
p245_076|I'd like to continue that record.
p245_077|That is bound to happen.
p245_078|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p245_079|We have other options.
p245_080|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p245_081|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p245_082|It's never too late.
p245_083|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p245_084|Now the system is right behind us.
p245_085|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p245_086|It is a lifeline.
p245_087|The reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
p245_088|Then came the crunch.
p245_089|If you could find it.
p245_090|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p245_091|They were outside the circle.
p245_092|He's a star.
p245_093|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p245_094|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p245_095|Oil embargo endorsed.
p245_096|No date has been set for the appeal.
p245_097|It was an adventure.
p245_098|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p245_099|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p245_100|I was angry.
p245_101|That team is due to be announced this morning.
p245_102|I have had no social life at all.
p245_103|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p245_104|I'm delighted about that.
p245_105|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p245_106|Who would be a referee?
p245_107|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p245_108|Who would have?
p245_109|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p245_110|We work on the same level.
p245_111|I can't even get into the A team.
p245_112|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p245_113|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p245_114|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p245_115|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p245_116|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p245_117|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p245_118|He has been under great pressure.
p245_119|Who will attend?
p245_120|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p245_121|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p245_122|What will happen then?
p245_123|Is that it?
p245_124|He was in a great deal of pain.
p245_125|We want to keep the pound.
p245_126|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p245_127|There is a lack of chemistry.
p245_128|I was awful.
p245_129|That group reported just before Christmas.
p245_130|It is not just about pay.
p245_131|He will emerge as a world leader.
p245_132|They did very well.
p245_133|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p245_134|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p245_135|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p245_136|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p245_137|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p245_138|Mr Blair had done well.
p245_139|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p245_140|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p245_141|He can do no wrong.
p245_142|Was this element always there?
p245_143|I've learned from my mistakes.
p245_144|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p245_145|It has to be now.
p245_146|I was in the train station overnight.
p245_147|The release attracted little attention.
p245_148|That will do for me.
p245_149|Nobody did in those days.
p245_150|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p245_151|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p245_152|It became a book by itself.
p245_154|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p245_155|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p245_156|The hotel was now for sale.
p245_157|I drove the ball well.
p245_158|Everyone can be bought.
p245_160|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p245_161|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p245_162|They will run a mile.
p245_163|We did everything by the book.
p245_164|It is not fair.
p245_165|What has caused the demise of singing?
p245_166|I had a train to catch.
p245_167|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p245_168|It is tough, but possible.
p245_170|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p245_171|People will ask about us.
p245_172|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p245_173|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p245_174|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p245_175|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p245_176|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p245_177|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p245_178|It was still there, but right at the end.
p245_179|The conference is the first test.
p245_180|Is that success?
p245_181|But we are not immune to the problem.
p245_182|The red card was okay.
p245_183|I have a cold.
p245_184|They are in the euro.
p245_185|He's not perfect.
p245_186|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p245_187|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p245_188|It's all about money, money, money.
p245_189|That will be vital.
p245_190|Now, it's all right.
p245_191|It's like a garage.
p245_192|We don't even know his name.
p245_193|Feel the heat?
p245_194|He knows a lot.
p245_195|I began to pray.
p245_196|I had decided to quit the show.
p245_197|His third goal was superb.
p245_198|It's been a good year.
p245_199|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p245_200|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p245_201|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p245_202|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p245_203|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p245_204|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p245_205|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p245_206|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p245_207|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p245_208|He demanded to speak to the boss.
p245_209|You have to do your research.
p245_210|Saturday is gone.
p245_211|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p245_212|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p245_213|It was good fun.
p245_214|At the time, he was a living legend.
p245_215|It's so special.
p245_216|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p245_217|I can't wait to meet him.
p245_218|My wife and family are the support system.
p245_219|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p245_220|They had no children.
p245_221|We are in the hat.
p245_222|We were a load of rubbish.
p245_223|They should come forward.
p245_224|It is not the message alone.
p245_225|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p245_226|It's quite a line-up!
p245_227|I might get an injury very easily.
p245_228|This fact is supported by audience research.
p245_229|He was good, but not that good.
p245_230|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p245_231|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p245_232|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p245_233|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p245_234|It's only fair.
p245_235|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p245_236|You can feel at home in China.
p245_237|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p245_238|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p245_239|There wasn't a goal.
p245_240|I was shocked.
p245_241|They are different types.
p245_242|It was a hit.
p245_243|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
p245_244|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p245_245|This year I understood.
p245_246|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p245_247|They need to look after themselves.
p245_248|Is there on his hands?
p245_249|I can't get a job.
p245_250|It is nearly there.
p245_251|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p245_252|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p245_253|It's that kind of place.
p245_254|they fail to engage.
p245_256|I was happily surprised.
p245_257|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p245_258|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p245_259|I HAVE a dream.
p245_260|It is set in Paris.
p245_261|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p245_262|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p245_263|Immediate action must be taken.
p245_264|It left me with a sadness.
p245_265|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p245_266|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p245_267|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p245_268|Of course I was tempted.
p245_269|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p245_270|People have no choice.
p245_271|She looked so young.
p245_272|It happens from time to time.
p245_273|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p245_274|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p245_275|You've got to have both sides.
p245_276|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p245_277|It was a virus.
p245_278|Yet, it worked.
p245_279|It's very safe.
p245_280|Well, he can do it.
p245_281|He was obviously very genuine.
p245_282|It goes back a long way.
p245_283|The weather forecast isn't good.
p245_284|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p245_285|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p245_286|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p245_287|That could change.
p245_288|The goals will come.
p245_289|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p245_290|This is a huge confidence boost.
p245_291|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p245_292|He has retired.
p245_293|There was no hint of scandal.
p245_294|I thought it was my only chance.
p245_295|Nothing is safe.
p245_296|They are wrong.
p245_297|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p245_298|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p245_299|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p245_300|It's just not funny!
p245_301|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p245_302|And he goes with it.
p245_303|You are the glory.
p245_304|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p245_305|We want to play at the worlds.
p245_306|We have waited a long time for this.
p245_307|He was solid.
p245_308|This is the culture change in medicine.
p245_309|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p245_310|It also provides a wealth of contrast within the movement.
p245_311|I never thought it would take this long.
p245_312|They wanted the club to make money.
p245_313|Craig is a major concern for us.
p245_314|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p245_315|They had a confession.
p245_316|I am very happy to be here.
p245_317|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p245_318|There was no time scale.
p245_319|My view has now completely changed.
p245_320|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p245_321|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p245_322|The boat was fantastic.
p245_323|I saw some good things.
p245_324|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p245_325|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p245_326|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p245_327|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
p245_328|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p245_329|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p245_330|Who will do it?
p245_331|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p245_332|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p245_333|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p245_334|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p245_335|The train was on time.
p245_336|Action is needed now.
p245_337|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p245_338|Indeed, it was magical.
p245_339|I would miss him.
p246_001|Please call Stella.
p246_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p246_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p246_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p246_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p246_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p246_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p246_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p246_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p246_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p246_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p246_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p246_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p246_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p246_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p246_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p246_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p246_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p246_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p246_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p246_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p246_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p246_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p246_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p246_025|He has not been named.
p246_026|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p246_027|Is this accurate?
p246_028|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p246_029|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p246_030|There's a story, too.
p246_031|This is the window.
p246_032|He was jailed for five years.
p246_033|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p246_034|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p246_035|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p246_036|It has failed.
p246_037|They're just different.
p246_038|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p246_039|Indeed, he does.
p246_040|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p246_041|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p246_042|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p246_043|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p246_044|We will push.
p246_045|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p246_046|They said she was stable.
p246_047|Is a drug dealer?
p246_048|There is no reason at all.
p246_049|The State would provide.
p246_050|She looked so young.
p246_051|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p246_052|Here's a clue.
p246_053|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p246_054|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p246_055|It is unique.
p246_056|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p246_057|That's the truth.
p246_058|I feel I did not have enough time.
p246_059|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p246_060|Scotland had great assets.
p246_061|It's that kind of place.
p246_062|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p246_063|He could make it.
p246_064|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p246_065|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p246_066|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p246_067|There could be a way back.
p246_068|Then followed a bout of flu.
p246_069|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p246_070|It is a job creation scheme.
p246_071|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p246_072|Even the one she loved.
p246_073|People must remain vigilant.
p246_074|Today she has been released.
p246_075|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p246_076|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p246_077|He is in the queue.
p246_078|I first met him last summer.
p246_079|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p246_080|A play is a set of actions.
p246_081|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p246_082|It is a blow.
p246_083|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p246_084|They lived for their children.
p246_085|It will be tight.
p246_086|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p246_087|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p246_088|Tony Blair said as little.
p246_089|As, indeed, they would be.
p246_090|This one did.
p246_091|It was clear.
p246_092|But I was wrong.
p246_093|It is home-grown.
p246_094|I saw the whole thing.
p246_095|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p246_096|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p246_097|They make a selective perception process.
p246_098|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p246_099|No, the equipment is extra.
p246_100|That would be unlawful.
p246_101|Oil embargo endorsed.
p246_102|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p246_103|Before the game we went for a pint.
p246_104|It was an adventure.
p246_105|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p246_106|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p246_107|Is that right?
p246_108|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p246_109|It was the eighties.
p246_110|It is so sad.
p246_111|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p246_112|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p246_113|Who would be a referee?
p246_114|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p246_115|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p246_116|Who would have?
p246_117|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p246_118|There were no grounds for his action.
p246_119|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p246_120|She really suffered for her art.
p246_121|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p246_122|It is not a U-turn.
p246_123|I just wanted a break.
p246_124|Twaddle is a case in point.
p246_125|I am now unemployed.
p246_126|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p246_127|It plans to return to this field.
p246_128|It's perfectly feasible.
p246_129|We work well together.
p246_130|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p246_131|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p246_132|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p246_133|My daughter is an adult.
p246_134|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p246_135|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p246_136|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p246_137|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p246_138|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
p246_139|She died at her home.
p246_140|He realises his mistake.
p246_141|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p246_142|I was awful.
p246_143|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p246_144|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p246_145|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p246_146|It is not just about pay.
p246_147|I am just trying to do my job.
p246_148|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p246_149|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p246_150|I was stunned.
p246_151|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p246_152|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p246_153|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p246_154|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p246_155|We are on a four-year mission.
p246_156|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p246_157|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p246_158|I'd love to be like Peter.
p246_159|I will tell you.
p246_160|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p246_161|It is not like us.
p246_162|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p246_163|We have a budget in March.
p246_164|Again, we were lucky.
p246_165|We should do everything at a stroke.
p246_166|You had to go and see him.
p246_167|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p246_168|He was a crazy man.
p246_169|As we worked.
p246_170|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p246_171|It is not either national standards or local control.
p246_172|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p246_173|I drove the ball well.
p246_174|Tony had arrived.
p246_175|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p246_176|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p246_177|The goals were good.
p246_178|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p246_179|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p246_180|They need to look after themselves.
p246_181|It's to do with context.
p246_182|Does this matter?
p246_183|One was a lawyer.
p246_184|There is no openness.
p246_185|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p246_186|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p246_187|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p246_188|It was very frightened and dirty.
p246_189|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p246_190|The concerns are the same.
p246_191|Is that success?
p246_192|I do not own the vessel in question.
p246_193|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p246_194|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p246_195|Who will pay for this?
p246_196|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p246_197|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p246_198|It's all about money, money, money.
p246_199|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p246_200|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p246_201|I will win.
p246_202|Feel the heat?
p246_203|He knows a lot.
p246_204|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p246_205|It had all been arranged.
p246_206|I have decided to quit the show.
p246_207|My neighbours are horrified.
p246_208|It's not ideal.
p246_209|In each case they were a goal down.
p246_210|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p246_211|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p246_212|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p246_213|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p246_214|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p246_215|The report is due out next month.
p246_216|Because they didn't want to know.
p246_217|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p246_218|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p246_219|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p246_220|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p246_221|I'd never seen a play about me.
p246_222|It's not before time.
p246_223|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p246_224|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p246_225|But she was.
p246_226|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p246_227|At the time, he was a living legend.
p246_228|My wife and family are the support system.
p246_229|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p246_230|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p246_231|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
p246_232|Of course I was tempted.
p246_233|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p246_234|You should be.
p246_235|It's quite nice.
p246_236|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p246_237|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p246_238|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p246_239|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p246_240|It is hard won.
p246_241|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p246_242|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p246_243|The scene is about this?
p246_244|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p246_245|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.

p246_322|Off with their heads.
p246_323|There was no time scale.
p246_324|Either team will be hard.
p246_325|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p246_326|He scored a touchdown.
p246_327|Is that an issue?
p246_328|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p246_329|Who will do it?
p246_330|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p246_331|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p246_332|This is the last straw.
p246_333|Two people were interviewed.
p246_334|I've got no secret.

p246_340|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p247_001|Please call Stella.  )
p247_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
p247_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
p247_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
p247_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )
p247_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
p247_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
p247_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
p247_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
p247_010|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
p247_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
p247_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
p247_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
p247_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
p247_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
p247_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
p247_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
p247_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
p247_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
p247_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
p247_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
p247_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
p247_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
p247_025|They are very clever in their use of words.)
p247_026|Meetings will also remain private.)
p247_027|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.)

p247_328|We believe the world has too many refugees already.)
p247_329|Investors can be forgiven for caution.)
p247_330|The party lasted all night.)
p247_331|This is a moment to seize.)
p247_332|They come to enjoy themselves.)
p247_333|The people will not be patient.)
p247_334|And he goes with it.)
p247_335|Scotland has shown the way.)
p247_336|Then followed a bout of flu.)
p247_337|We will listen to any suggestion.)
p247_338|It was an achievement all right.)
p247_339|The election is total confusion and chaos.)
p247_340|The whole thing is utterly transparent.)
p247_341|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.)
p247_342|It is inherent in society.)
p247_343|Are they free ?)
p247_344|What are they for ?)
p247_345|Is there a waiting list ?)
p247_346|Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
p247_347|So what happens next ?)
p247_348|Had this been common practice ?)
p247_349|What do they want us to do ?)
p247_350|Is it worth it ?)
p247_351|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.)
p247_352|There was some merit in that.)
p247_353|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.)
p247_354|That is a trend which will be encouraged.)
p247_355|But the New Year was special.)
p247_356|Other people had looked at it.)
p247_357|It was tough to contain the excitement.)
p247_358|The pain is still acute.)
p247_359|He said something in his work.)
p247_360|It's wonderful to have won.)
p247_361|Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.)
p247_362|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.)
p247_363|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.)
p247_364|But we welcome this document.)
p247_365|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.)
p247_366|He can handle it without any problem.)
p247_367|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.)
p247_368|I think we'll just keep it.)
p247_369|It is a stroke of genius.)
p247_370|He had no access to the database.)
p247_371|The members have voted against it.)
p247_372|He had no previous convictions.)
p247_373|Neither woman has been named.)
p247_374|I got a yellow card.)
p247_375|They have broken that promise.)
p247_376|That is a crazy situation.)
p247_377|Two things were clear from the new programme.)
p247_378|Yesterday was a statement of intent.)
p247_379|The group is not paying a dividend.)
p247_380|The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.)
p247_381|The major championships will always have a special place.)
p247_382|There is no deal as yet.)
p247_383|It's as wide as a church in here.)
p247_384|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.)
p247_385|to have products for their needs.)
p247_386|The pair are very much in love.)
p247_387|The team hadn't been picked.)
p247_388|It benefits the whole family.)
p247_389|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.)
p247_390|Glasgow University declined to comment.)
p247_391|He will consult the right people.)
p247_392|Rugby has an extended run.)
p247_393|It has happened for generations.)
p247_394|Theatre is not a museum.)
p247_395|He took over our lives.)
p247_396|It seems a long time ago.)
p247_397|They have not done so this season so far.)
p247_398|It is a simple equation.)
p247_399|Ferguson must take the blame.)
p247_400|That investment has now been secured.)
p247_401|It proved a good decision.)
p247_402|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.)
p247_403|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.)
p247_404|The BBC was a disgrace.)
p247_405|The Cabinet is split over the issue.)
p247_406|But the foundations have been laid.)
p247_407|There was an element of frustration.)
p247_408|But they can also be managed by telephone.)
p247_409|The idea was first mooted a year ago.)
p247_410|The casualties were not named.)
p247_411|Does it matter ?)
p247_412|How do you take them away ?)
p247_413|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
p247_414|After the match, do you ?)
p247_415|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.)
p247_416|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.)
p247_417|Shelter also supports the reform.)
p247_418|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.)
p247_419|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.)
p247_420|That is not the position of the British relatives.)
p247_421|He seems to be used to the attention.)
p247_422|The projections are very positive for South Africa.)
p247_423|That's been all around Europe with me.)
p247_424|Surrey police said no body had been found.)
p247_425|It was submitted without their knowledge.)
p247_426|Being captain of this club is fantastic.)
p247_427|My aim is a top six finish.)
p247_428|A similar scheme is under way in central Scotland.)
p247_429|Such an attack is bizarre.)
p247_430|The success of the Open Eye has enabled the business to expand.)
p247_431|No date has been fixed for his return.)
p247_432|It was a breathtaking moment.)
p247_433|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.)
p247_434|No-one wanted to run it tonight.)
p247_435|It's going to be epic.)
p247_436|There is another important factor.)
p247_437|We've made a couple of albums.)
p247_438|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.)
p247_439|An alternative must be offered.)
p247_440|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.)
p247_441|There is no hiding place.)
p247_442|Their condition is described as satisfactory.)
p247_443|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)
p247_444|The Allies intend to maintain the average.)
p247_445|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.)
p247_446|It wouldn't matter if he had.)
p247_447|That will be best for him.)
p247_448|There were no formal announcements.)
p247_449|He deserves a second chance.)
p247_450|It certainly appeared that way.)
p247_451|But you can go beyond that condition.)
p247_452|Blair is very positive at European Councils.)
p247_453|It could cause a little bit of disruption.)
p247_454|Police have appealed for witnesses.)
p247_455|People are so negative about the whole business.)
p247_456|Discussions will continue with the industry in Scotland.)
p247_457|It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.)
p247_458|It might be useful to have something in black and white.)
p248_001|Please call Stella.
p248_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p248_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p248_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p248_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p248_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p248_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p248_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p248_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p248_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p248_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p248_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p248_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p248_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p248_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p248_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p248_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p248_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p248_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p248_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p248_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p248_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p248_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p248_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p248_025|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p248_026|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p248_027|But it failed.
p248_028|That's no bad thing.
p248_029|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p248_030|I have a theory.
p248_031|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
p248_032|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p248_033|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p248_034|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p248_035|I expected these kind of questions.
p248_036|It's a matter of balance.
p248_037|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p248_038|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p248_039|It was clear.
p248_040|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p248_041|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p248_042|I was scared.
p248_043|It was ugly.
p248_044|That is a break with tradition.
p248_045|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p248_046|No meaningful response was issued.
p248_047|It is urgent.
p248_048|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p248_049|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p248_050|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p248_051|But it might have done.
p248_052|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p248_053|He looks like an Afghan.
p248_054|They had to explain it.
p248_055|Here's a clue.
p248_056|But the law is very clear on this.
p248_057|Next league matches Celtic.
p248_058|It's very odd.
p248_059|It will take time.
p248_060|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p248_061|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p248_062|Four other charges were dropped.
p248_063|It is not great art.
p248_064|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p248_065|Scotland had great assets.
p248_066|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p248_067|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p248_068|It's good news and long overdue.
p248_069|Have a look at our accounts.
p248_070|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p248_071|There was an e-mail.
p248_072|Then followed a bout of flu.
p248_073|Neither it is.
p248_074|I had my suspicions.
p248_075|He got the same story.
p248_076|It works for us.
p248_077|It is a time bomb.
p248_078|Today she has been released.
p248_079|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p248_080|It may well have been.
p248_081|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p248_082|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p248_083|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p248_084|We have other options.
p248_085|By then, he was walking on water.
p248_086|It's never too late.
p248_087|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p248_088|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p248_089|They lived for their children.
p248_090|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p248_091|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p248_092|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p248_093|He was possessed
p248_094|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p248_095|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p248_096|It is a delight on every level.
p248_097|I had a ball today.
p248_098|Two of the team became ill.
p248_099|That's all right then.
p248_100|That would be unlawful.
p248_101|That time is not now, however.
p248_102|Oil embargo endorsed.
p248_103|I didn't play well last year.
p248_104|That is no use.
p248_105|That all hope is never lost.
p248_106|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p248_107|He pleaded for caution.
p248_108|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p248_109|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p248_110|It had been played at festivals.
p248_111|We do not expect any surplus.
p248_112|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p248_113|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p248_114|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p248_115|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p248_116|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p248_117|Maybe this battle has been.
p248_118|But the fans deserve to know!
p248_119|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p248_120|They've got to account for it.
p248_121|She's got to say something.
p248_122|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p248_123|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p248_124|I can't even get into the A team.
p248_125|She does not want to speak.
p248_126|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p248_127|So the European elections are extremely important.
p248_128|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p248_129|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p248_130|I had relied on him.
p248_131|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p248_132|It's the big omission.
p248_133|It plans to return to this field.
p248_134|Our intentions are real.
p248_135|Government will intervene.
p248_136|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p248_137|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p248_138|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p248_139|It was typical.
p248_140|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p248_141|He has the edge.
p248_142|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p248_143|It's a crucial award.
p248_144|He is severe.
p248_145|There is a lack of chemistry.
p248_146|This film will be totally awesome.
p248_147|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p248_148|It is like a football team.
p248_149|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p248_150|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p248_151|It is huge.
p248_152|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p248_153|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p248_154|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p248_155|They were later discharged from hospital.
p248_156|That includes the equipment?
p248_157|They should stop the bombing.
p248_158|That's the name of the game, though.
p248_159|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p248_160|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p248_161|Eight months later, he was dead.
p248_162|It has to be now.
p248_163|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p248_164|I was in the train station overnight.
p248_165|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p248_166|It's that sort of night.
p248_167|We have a budget in March.
p248_168|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p248_169|The post will be unpaid.
p248_170|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p248_171|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p248_172|They thought they had found a home.
p248_173|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p248_174|The jury is still out.
p248_175|Blair's response was weak.
p248_176|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p248_177|And I saw the light!
p248_178|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p248_179|Tony had arrived.
p248_180|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p248_181|The goals were good.
p248_182|I've been there.
p248_183|Four policemen were wounded.
p248_184|They receive a high profile in the media.
p248_185|We did everything by the book.
p248_186|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p248_187|They need to look after themselves.
p248_188|What has caused the demise of singing?
p248_189|You know the sort of thing.
p248_190|I cannot say too much about them.
p248_191|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p248_192|All options are open.
p248_193|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p248_194|However, this idea is never developed.
p248_195|It wasn't to be.
p248_196|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p248_197|It's the same old story.
p248_198|It was still there, but right at the end.
p248_199|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p248_200|The service from the other players was super.
p248_201|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p248_202|But she might be.
p248_203|It's just awful.
p248_204|Today was first class.
p248_205|It was worth a photograph.
p248_206|We have an election in eight days.
p248_207|Now, it's all right.
p248_208|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p248_209|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p248_210|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p248_211|He is slightly confused.
p248_212|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p248_213|Twaddle is a case in point.
p248_214|It had all been arranged.
p248_215|In each case they were a goal down.
p248_216|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
p248_217|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p248_218|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p248_219|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p248_220|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p248_221|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p248_222|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p248_223|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p248_224|It was good fun.
p248_225|I have spoken to the skipper.
p248_226|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p248_227|The track is currently covered in snow.
p248_228|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p248_229|At the time, he was a living legend.
p248_230|It's the same as Glasgow.
p248_231|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p248_232|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p248_233|It is set in Paris.
p248_234|They should come forward.
p248_235|I haven't made the donation yet.
p248_236|It's very safe.
p248_237|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p248_238|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p248_239|It is no surprise.
p248_240|My future is in the marathon.
p248_241|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p248_242|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p248_243|She is well balanced.
p248_244|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p248_245|It is hard won.
p248_246|The scene is about this?
p248_247|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p248_248|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p248_249|It was a cry for help.
p248_250|It was a hit.
p248_251|This year I understood.
p248_252|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p248_253|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p248_254|We run within the law.
p248_255|Kirkwood was arrested.
p248_256|they fail to engage.
p248_257|They are real.
p248_258|They must play for each other.
p248_259|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p248_260|It is also very valuable.
p248_261|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p248_262|That is highly unfair.
p248_263|He will emerge as a world leader.
p248_264|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p248_265|This is a question of Islam.
p248_266|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p248_267|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p248_268|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p248_269|Immediate action must be taken.
p248_270|He is a young man with a new deal.
p248_271|He was also married with two children.
p248_272|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p248_273|It's a way of life.
p248_274|I feel pretty good.
p248_275|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p248_276|If not, he should go home.
p248_277|He looked very sharp.
p248_278|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p248_279|You've got to have both sides.
p248_280|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p248_281|He will address the nation this evening.
p248_282|It was a virus.
p248_283|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p248_284|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p248_285|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p248_286|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p248_287|It is not normal practice.
p248_288|The release attracted little attention.
p248_289|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p248_290|IT S all in the hair.
p248_291|What has altered?
p248_292|I thought it was my only chance.
p248_293|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p248_294|Our task is to complete the picture.
p248_295|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p248_296|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p248_297|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p248_298|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p248_299|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p248_300|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p248_301|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p248_302|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p248_303|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p248_304|We have waited a long time for this.
p248_305|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p248_306|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p248_307|It should be equal.
p248_308|Craig is a major concern for us.
p248_309|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p248_310|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p248_311|Other people had looked at it.
p248_312|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p248_313|Off with their heads.
p248_314|The parents will have a great time, too.
p248_315|Donald was his friend.
p248_316|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
p248_317|He was unable to come.
p248_318|I saw some good things.
p248_319|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p248_320|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p248_321|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p248_322|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p248_323|Who will do it?
p248_324|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p248_325|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p248_326|This is the way things should be handled.
p248_327|The train was on time.
p248_328|You were very proud that day to be among their friends.
p248_329|He has to learn.
p248_330|Indeed, it was magical.
p248_331|There's no place to hide.
p248_332|It will be very, very tight.
p248_333|I said that I had been raped.
p248_334|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p248_335|The composer will conduct.
p248_336|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p248_337|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p248_338|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p248_339|It's the last thing on my mind.
p248_340|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p248_341|I'd like to take the plunge.
p248_342|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p248_343|It is horrible.
p248_344|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p248_345|I kept going for her.
p248_346|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p248_347|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p248_348|But nothing happened.
p248_349|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p248_350|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p248_351|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p248_352|He has seen the past.
p248_353|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p248_354|It was that bad, that low.
p248_355|That would help.
p248_356|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p249_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p249_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p249_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p249_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p249_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p249_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p249_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p249_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p249_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p249_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p249_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p249_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p249_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p249_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p249_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p249_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p249_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p249_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p249_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p249_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p249_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p249_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p249_025|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p249_026|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p249_027|It's nice to hear.
p249_028|They should be so lucky.
p249_029|Because we do not need it.
p249_030|There's a story, too.
p249_031|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p249_032|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p249_033|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p249_034|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p249_035|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p249_036|It was clear.
p249_037|It is not for any other purpose.
p249_038|He did not know his daughter.
p249_039|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p249_040|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p249_041|Sure, it's funny.
p249_042|It's a crucial award.
p249_043|The boy is no longer with us.
p249_044|It's a blessing.
p249_045|Is a drug dealer?
p249_046|As she explains.
p249_047|He is too weak to move.
p249_048|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p249_049|I would love to have him home.
p249_050|He looks like an Afghan.
p249_051|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p249_052|It will come all right.
p249_053|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p249_054|Next league matches Celtic.
p249_055|It happens from time to time.
p249_056|It's very odd.
p249_057|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p249_058|It is unique.
p249_059|It will take time.
p249_060|That's the truth.
p249_061|Jobs could go.
p249_062|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p249_063|I'm just enjoying every match.
p249_064|And a film maker was born.
p249_065|You did not change overnight.
p249_066|There was a battle there.
p249_067|Scotland had great assets.
p249_068|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p249_069|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p249_070|Have a look at our accounts.
p249_071|It is like a river running by my home.
p249_072|Try to save us.
p249_073|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p249_074|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p249_075|Painful, but only because it's true.
p249_076|The play is based on a real-life event.
p249_077|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p249_078|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p249_079|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p249_080|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p249_081|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p249_082|It is a job creation scheme.
p249_083|Even the one she loved.
p249_084|I've not thought about it.
p249_086|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p249_087|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p249_088|She had kept the news from him.
p249_089|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p249_090|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p249_092|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p249_093|And rugby fans can help.
p249_094|They lived for their children.
p249_095|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p249_096|Now the system is right behind us.
p249_097|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p249_098|Today I couldn't run on it.
p249_099|However, it did not end that way.
p249_100|We must look forward.
p249_101|It is an old family habit.
p249_102|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p249_103|Until you hit the big games.
p249_104|Then came the crunch.
p249_105|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p249_106|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p249_107|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p249_108|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
p249_109|It is a good day for the coalition.
p249_110|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p249_111|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p249_112|It is a good lifestyle.
p249_113|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p249_114|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p249_115|You had better believe it.
p249_116|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p249_117|It's a long process.
p249_118|They were behind the wheel.
p249_119|It was ugly.
p249_120|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p249_121|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
p249_122|Does this mean.
p249_123|They've got to account for it.
p249_124|Who would have?
p249_125|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p249_126|You can spend money on housing.
p249_127|There were no grounds for his action.
p249_128|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p249_129|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p249_130|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of a nation.
p249_131|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p249_132|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p249_133|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p249_134|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
p249_135|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p249_136|What will happen then?
p249_137|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p249_138|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p249_139|It was very frightened and dirty.
p249_140|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p249_141|It's a question of fashion.
p249_142|We need to chat.
p249_143|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p249_144|He is severe.
p249_145|It is difficult for Ali.
p249_146|Is that Titanic?
p249_147|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p249_148|The idea is simple.
p249_149|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p249_150|It is like a football team.
p249_152|It is not just about pay.
p249_153|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p249_154|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p249_155|The weaknesses are few.
p249_156|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p249_157|It is not normal practice.
p249_159|It was by the numbers.
p249_160|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p249_161|There's a pause.
p249_162|Neither side can win this war.
p249_163|They should stop the bombing.
p249_164|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p249_165|These days are long gone.
p249_166|It is an attitude of mind.
p249_167|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p249_168|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p249_169|They say that vital evidence was not heard in the court.
p249_170|I'm so worried about the roads.
p249_171|We have to move forward.
p249_172|Tell it like it was?
p249_173|It is not too late to get on board.
p249_174|We have a budget in March.
p249_176|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p249_177|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p249_178|The release attracted little attention.
p249_179|Someone who cares
p249_180|I always felt they played for me.
p249_181|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p249_182|The jury is still out.
p249_183|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p249_184|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p249_185|It is not either national standards or local control.
p249_186|It should be easy.
p249_187|Everyone can be bought.
p249_188|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p249_189|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p249_190|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p249_191|It is not fair.
p249_192|Miller was every bit as happy.
p249_193|We want to help them through it.
p249_194|I put the drawing down.
p249_196|I had a train to catch.
p249_197|It is tough, but possible.
p249_198|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p249_199|However, this idea is never developed.
p249_200|Last night was a key episode.
p249_201|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p249_202|It is a case of taking a risk.
p249_203|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p249_204|Sir Paul McCartney said he had been shocked by the attack.
p249_205|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p249_206|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p249_207|The service from the other players was super.
p249_208|He has a lot of experience as a captain in his career.
p249_209|I have a cold.
p249_210|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p249_211|Ferguson should take note.
p249_212|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p249_213|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p249_214|It's all about money, money, money.
p249_216|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p249_217|This is a good move for me.
p249_218|But I am a worried man.
p249_219|There was an e-mail.
p249_220|Feel the heat?
p249_221|We'll have to work hard today.
p249_222|Twaddle is a case in point.
p249_223|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p249_224|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p249_225|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p249_226|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p249_229|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p249_230|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p249_231|It is a gamble.
p249_232|My neighbours are horrified.
p249_234|He is in the queue.
p249_235|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p249_236|Broke the birdie record.
p249_237|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p249_238|We were a load of rubbish.
p249_239|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p249_240|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p249_241|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p249_243|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p249_244|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p249_245|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
p249_246|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p249_247|There wasn't a goal.
p249_248|I was shocked.
p249_249|I should think so, too.
p249_251|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p249_252|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p249_253|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p249_254|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p249_255|It is very important that we get the balance right.
p249_256|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p249_257|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p249_258|They must play for each other.
p249_259|His contract was then not renewed.
p249_260|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
p249_261|That's the only thing I will say.
p249_262|Blood samples were taken.
p249_263|They are never here.
p249_265|He has not created a Festival resource.
p249_266|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p249_267|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p249_268|It is the same in Sweden.
p249_269|And Michael was just great.
p249_270|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p249_271|It's not even finished.
p249_272|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p249_273|Things can change.
p249_274|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p249_275|People have no choice.
p249_276|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p249_277|He has a wealth of experience.
p249_278|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p249_279|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p249_280|There's nothing I can say.
p249_281|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p249_282|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p249_283|You've got to have both sides.
p249_284|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p249_285|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p249_286|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p249_287|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p249_288|Scotland were beaten again.
p249_289|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p249_290|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p249_291|These figures are truly awful.
p249_292|He should have won.
p249_293|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p249_294|A new school will be built.
p249_295|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p249_296|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p249_297|What has altered?
p249_298|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p249_299|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p249_300|Our task is to complete the picture.
p249_301|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p249_302|They are wrong.
p249_303|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p249_304|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p249_305|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p249_306|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p249_307|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p249_308|And he goes with it.
p249_309|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p249_310|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p249_311|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p249_312|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p249_313|Is there on his hands?
p249_314|Special measures were needed.
p249_315|They were fantastic.
p249_316|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p249_317|They wanted the club to make money.
p249_318|The problems began a long time ago.
p249_319|Referees are easy targets.
p249_320|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p249_321|I came into this world with nothing.
p249_322|That's the law of the land.
p249_323|There was no time scale.
p249_324|I am so upset.
p249_326|It could have gone either way.
p249_327|He was then replaced by Ross.
p249_328|My view has now completely changed.
p249_329|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p249_330|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
p249_331|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p250_001|Please call Stella.
p250_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p250_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p250_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p250_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p250_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p250_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p250_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p250_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p250_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p250_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p250_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p250_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p250_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p250_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p250_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p250_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p250_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p250_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p250_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p250_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p250_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p250_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p250_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p250_025|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p250_026|Meetings will also remain private.
p250_027|I am pretty careful with money.
p250_028|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p250_030|This is a central issue.
p250_031|We will not tolerate it.
p250_032|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p250_033|He works at the airport.
p250_034|Smoking is also very important.
p250_035|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p250_036|It was just appalling luck.
p250_037|Rugby has an extended run.
p250_038|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p250_039|Costs have got to be controlled.
p250_040|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p250_042|No meaningful response was issued.
p250_043|This represents a tough game for us.
p250_044|I made a terrible start.
p250_045|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p250_046|How are you, sir ?
p250_047|So is that it, then ?
p250_048|Do I have a favourite ?
p250_049|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p250_050|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p250_051|Strikers like to go to the ground.
p250_052|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
p250_053|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p250_054|I had trouble with the producers.
p250_055|The teacher would have approved.
p250_056|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p250_057|I expect a rapid response.
p250_058|She said she was really sorry.
p250_059|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p250_060|There's still plenty time left.
p250_061|Let's hope that it does.
p250_062|We have to keep our clients.
p250_063|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p250_064|Companies are now seeking to recover their losses.
p250_065|This is the first step.
p250_066|We will pay their bills.
p250_067|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
p250_068|The Farmer wants a new campaign.
p250_069|Only water is currently allowed.
p250_070|I am about protecting the state pension.
p250_071|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p250_072|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p250_073|It wasn't possible to relax.
p250_074|We need to increase the membership.
p250_075|There's nothing they can get on me.
p250_076|I was as strong as a horse.
p250_077|He was a lovely man.
p250_078|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p250_079|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
p250_080|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p250_081|It makes for an interesting conference.
p250_082|I've had it for the exams.
p250_083|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p250_084|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p250_085|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p250_086|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p250_087|They lived for their children.
p250_088|Potions said he would drive.
p250_089|I think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence.
p250_090|William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.
p250_091|We are progressing with a few interested parties.
p250_092|That view is held by many others within the industry.
p250_093|The excitement could hardly be contained.
p250_094|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p250_095|It is high time to act.
p250_096|Why do it otherwise ?
p250_097|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p250_098|So, did she meet him ?
p250_099|So what is the campaign about ?
p250_100|And does it ?
p250_101|Are you from the rugby ?
p250_102|Had I heard ?
p250_103|It is an old family habit.
p250_104|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p250_105|He was released after treatment.
p250_106|We have made no final decisions.
p250_107|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p250_108|We knew they could do it.
p250_109|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
p250_110|They must be on commission.
p250_111|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p250_113|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
p250_114|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p250_115|It's good to have a voice.
p250_116|He was prepared for this.
p250_117|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p250_118|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p250_119|No, the equipment is extra.
p250_120|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p250_121|Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
p250_123|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
p250_124|Before the game we went for a pint.
p250_125|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
p250_126|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p250_127|I understand the medical concerns.
p250_128|That's not an assumption that I had made.
p250_129|I have learned from him.
p250_130|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
p250_131|He thought she was amazing.
p250_132|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p250_133|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p250_134|It isn't a happy memory.
p250_135|We have a team to reach the final.
p250_136|Failure is not an option.
p250_137|She's got to say something.
p250_138|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p250_139|This is a frightening development.
p250_140|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p250_141|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p250_142|That is far too high.
p250_143|My life has changed a lot.
p250_144|We did what we had to do.
p250_146|You've got to be vigilant.
p250_147|You are a gambling man.
p250_148|I had decided to quit the show.
p250_149|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
p250_150|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p250_151|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p250_152|We will try to find someone.
p250_153|She died at her home.
p250_154|What happened in that game ?
p250_155|Are you going to win ?
p250_156|Was it the wife ?
p250_157|Why change it ?
p250_158|What do we want to do that for ?
p250_159|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p250_160|He was pleased with his display.
p250_161|Life is still very tough for them.
p250_162|It is not just about pay.
p250_163|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p250_164|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p250_165|It has become a way of life.
p250_166|The whole industry is a shambles.
p250_167|People were actually not on his side.
p250_168|The defender made an impressive debut.
p250_169|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p250_170|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p250_171|They have not been named.
p250_172|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p250_173|Yesterday Abbey National said it had injected further capital into Scottish Provident.
p250_174|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p250_175|He was asked to quit.
p250_176|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p250_177|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
p250_178|I'd love to be like Peter.
p250_179|You will be very welcome.
p250_180|It had so much to do with output.
p250_181|That would open the gates of hell.
p250_182|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p250_183|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p250_184|They could not match it.
p250_185|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p250_186|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p250_187|This championship is different from the other majors.
p250_188|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p250_189|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p250_190|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
p250_191|Our fans have been marvellous.
p250_192|This could be an amazing attraction for Glasgow.
p250_193|They need to look after themselves.
p250_194|Miller was every bit as happy.
p250_195|They were seriously after him.
p250_196|It was a bit like having children.
p250_197|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p250_198|We represent a wide range of society.
p250_199|He was rejected because he had retired.
p250_200|We always felt we could win.
p250_201|It may have been a cry for help.
p250_202|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p250_204|We are going through difficult times.
p250_205|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p250_206|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p250_207|You could feel the heat.
p250_208|We have to be happy with a British and European record.
p250_209|It was a moment of madness.
p250_210|And we have the experience.
p250_211|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p250_212|It gave no further details.
p250_214|I won't make an official complaint.
p250_215|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
p250_216|It was worth a photograph.
p250_217|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p250_218|It carried a double message.
p250_219|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p250_220|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p250_221|That might help a bit.
p250_222|Does the name matter ?
p250_223|how do you get it back ?
p250_224|What are you not good at ?
p250_225|I think, therefore I am ?
p250_226|Who was she ?
p250_227|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
p250_228|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p250_229|It had all been arranged.
p250_230|My daughter is an adult.
p250_231|His third goal was superb.
p250_232|It will affect their work.
p250_233|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p250_234|I am considered a teenager.
p250_235|The process will start tomorrow.
p250_236|It's just a normal life.
p250_237|The transaction is not feasible.
p250_238|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p250_239|It is good for our team.
p250_240|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p250_241|That you can do it.
p250_242|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p250_243|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p250_244|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p250_245|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p250_246|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p250_247|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p250_248|I have spoken to the skipper.
p250_249|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p250_250|She will attend in July.
p250_251|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p250_252|The most important thing is the game.
p250_253|There is no timetable for completing such inquiries.
p250_254|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p250_255|The right decision has been made.
p250_257|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p250_258|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
p250_260|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p250_261|He was good, but not that good.
p250_262|At half-time he was presented to both teams.
p250_263|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
p250_264|He is a reporter for us.
p250_265|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p250_266|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p250_267|We've had several problems over injuries.
p250_268|That was a disgraceful performance.
p250_269|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p250_270|It was a kind of contempt.
p250_271|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p250_272|I should think so, too.
p250_273|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p250_274|Messages have to be reinforced.
p250_275|I got a yellow card.
p250_276|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p250_277|We accept the new rules.
p250_278|They are interior designers and architects.
p250_280|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p250_281|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p250_282|We are aiming for early March.
p250_283|I felt about this big.
p250_284|And they were being paid ?
p250_285|was everything done to save people ?
p250_286|What was the matter for concern ?
p250_287|Do I think about them often ?
p250_288|Is it in the right place ?
p250_289|It is also very valuable.
p250_290|I feel really confident in that department.
p250_291|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p250_292|Companies have only recently been allowed to compete on price.
p250_293|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p250_294|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p250_295|We shall rely on human beings.
p250_296|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p250_297|We would have no control over the threshold for repayment.
p250_298|He has not created a Festival resource.
p250_299|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p250_300|I understand the security issue.
p250_301|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p250_302|It was an easy decision to come here.
p250_304|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p250_305|Funding would come from both Scotland and Northern Ireland.
p250_306|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
p250_308|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
p250_309|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p250_310|You have to expect this type of thing.
p250_311|Stephen will get his first cap.
p250_312|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p250_313|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p250_314|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p250_315|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p250_316|I wanted to change the formula.
p250_317|He will address the nation this evening.
p250_318|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p250_319|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p250_320|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p250_321|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p250_322|The effect was almost magical.
p250_323|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
p250_324|Holland won by five wickets.
p250_325|There's still no-one like him.
p250_326|McNaughton was not so sure.
p250_327|I was brought up in a mining background.
p250_328|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p250_329|The takeover comes as no surprise.
p250_330|Job losses were also announced.
p250_331|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p250_332|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p250_333|The party lasted all night.
p250_334|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p250_335|It was nice to finish in style.
p250_336|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p250_337|Completion of the purchase is seen by the end of the year.
p250_338|And he goes with it.
p250_339|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p250_340|There will be good prospects ahead.
p250_341|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
p250_342|The letters are going out today.
p250_343|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p250_344|We will listen to any suggestion.
p250_345|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p250_346|He has made his base in Spain.
p250_348|A Home Office spokesman said.
p250_349|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p250_350|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p250_351|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p250_352|The pain is still acute.
p250_353|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p250_354|It's wonderful to have won.
p250_355|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p250_356|I'd like to take the plunge.
p250_357|Finally came the moment of truth.
p250_358|We have very limited capacity.
p250_359|Is our children learning ?
p250_360|What form did that take ?
p250_361|Are they free ?
p250_362|Is there a waiting list ?
p250_363|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p250_364|Three years ago he would have been.
p250_365|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
p250_366|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p250_367|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p250_368|We put our bid in last night.
p250_369|He had no access to the database.
p250_370|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p250_371|I was delighted to accept.
p250_372|They should take their mobile phones.
p250_374|It's fantastic to win again.
p250_375|We are really good friends.
p250_376|The salary changes are long overdue.
p250_377|Those people must be accountable.
p250_378|She said they would appeal.
p250_379|The countryside is in crisis.
p250_380|There is no deal as yet.
p250_381|It's as wide as a church in here.
p250_382|She is obviously very disappointed.
p250_383|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p250_384|They will fight for everything.
p250_385|We will win the argument.
p250_386|Is it worth it ?
p250_387|Does it matter ?
p250_388|How do you take them away ?
p250_389|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p250_390|After the match, do you ?
p250_391|The team hadn't been picked.
p250_392|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p250_393|One-third of the places are already taken.
p250_394|I always knew she was funny.
p250_395|Everyone could see the joke.
p250_396|The marshall at the turn was great.
p250_397|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
p250_398|He has earned the right to their respect.
p250_399|The law would appear to be on our side.
p250_400|There was a substantial explosion.
p250_401|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
p250_402|Theatre is not a museum.
p250_403|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p250_404|It has only been rumours.
p250_405|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p250_406|Rugby is a hard game.
p250_407|My immune system had been depleted.
p250_408|Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
p250_409|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p250_410|Growth will come later in the cycle.
p250_411|We're not taking any risks.
p250_412|Neither man has been charged.
p250_413|I had a fortunate war.
p250_414|The choice is strictly personal.
p250_415|It's too close to call.
p250_416|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p250_417|It became a national network.
p250_418|It is a large number.
p250_419|She started to put on weight.
p250_420|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p250_421|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p250_422|The BBC was a disgrace.
p250_423|Russell is delighted with them.
p250_424|The next few months will tell.
p250_425|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
p250_426|The second goal was superb.
p250_427|I am astonished at attack.
p250_428|There is a solution, she believes.
p250_429|That was the agreement with the manager.
p250_430|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p250_431|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
p250_432|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p250_433|First Minister Donald Dewar will respond.
p250_434|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p250_435|No date has been fixed for his return.
p250_436|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p250_437|The trial will open today.
p250_438|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president, Jim Walker, welcomed the new proposals.
p250_439|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p250_440|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
p250_441|There were a lot of emotions.
p250_442|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
p250_443|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p250_444|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p250_445|Everything in golf is a balance.
p250_446|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
p250_447|External auditors will monitor the action which is planned.
p250_448|The people around me were fantastic.
p250_449|That will be best for him.
p250_450|And we might go back.
p250_451|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p250_452|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
p250_453|But you can go beyond that condition.
p250_454|The removal would take place in France.
p250_455|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
p250_456|But we have built a platform for next season.
p250_457|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
p250_458|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
p250_459|The jury is still out.
p250_460|It was like someone had died.
p250_461|The budget was too low for that.
p250_462|Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
p250_463|Striking the deal has come as a big relief.
p250_464|The damage is all inside.
p250_465|Let that be their memorial.
p250_466|The boys are mentally focused.
p250_467|This is the stuff of live music.
p250_468|It may prove to be his last involvement with the club.
p250_469|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p250_471|I see no reason to have this debate at this time.
p250_472|He certainly did a good job!
p250_473|Talks between directors have been underway since last month.
p250_474|I am certainly thinking about retirement.
p250_475|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
p250_476|I have always believed in myself.
p251_001|Please call Stella.
p251_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p251_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p251_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p251_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p251_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p251_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p251_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p251_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p251_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p251_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p251_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p251_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p251_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p251_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p251_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p251_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p251_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p251_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p251_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p251_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p251_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p251_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p251_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p251_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p251_026|But it failed.
p251_027|That's no bad thing.
p251_028|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p251_029|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p251_030|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p251_032|It's a matter of balance.
p251_033|Peace was won.
p251_034|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p251_035|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p251_036|Was it worth it?
p251_037|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p251_038|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p251_039|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p251_040|It was clear.
p251_041|They may be wrong.
p251_042|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p251_043|Dancing was her life.
p251_044|We will push.
p251_045|I feel pretty good.
p251_046|That should do it.
p251_047|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p251_048|As she explains.
p251_049|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p251_050|It is the whole package.
p251_051|He had no enemies.
p251_052|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p251_053|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p251_054|I had relied on him.
p251_055|This is a step backwards.
p251_056|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p251_057|What was the main difference?
p251_058|Four other charges were dropped.
p251_059|It's a real challenge.
p251_060|It is not great art.
p251_061|They're appalled by that.
p251_062|It's that kind of place.
p251_063|It was all in a short period of time.
p251_064|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p251_065|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p251_066|He was popular.
p251_067|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p251_068|That was the easy election.
p251_069|There could be a way back.
p251_070|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p251_071|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p251_072|It was chaotic.
p251_073|It is a time bomb.
p251_074|I've not thought about it.
p251_075|Today she has been released.
p251_076|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p251_077|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p251_078|I was too young.
p251_079|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p251_080|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p251_081|War is not the action.
p251_082|You will be.
p251_083|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p251_084|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p251_085|We have turned the corner.
p251_087|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p251_088|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p251_089|We must look forward.
p251_090|It is an old family habit.
p251_091|Until you hit the big games.
p251_092|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p251_093|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p251_094|If you could find it.
p251_095|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p251_096|Journalists should make him.
p251_097|They were outside the circle.
p251_098|Two of the team became ill.
p251_099|That would be unlawful.
p251_100|No date has been set for the appeal.
p251_101|It is a good lifestyle.
p251_102|That is no use.
p251_103|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p251_104|Further protests are likely.
p251_105|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p251_106|He was jailed for a year.
p251_107|It had been played at festivals.
p251_108|I came to complete.
p251_109|You had better believe it.
p251_110|I was angry.
p251_111|The fire was above the hole.
p251_112|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p251_113|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p251_114|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p251_115|Maybe this battle has been.
p251_116|I joined a group.
p251_117|Does this mean.
p251_118|It is rubbish.
p251_119|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p251_120|We work on the same level.
p251_121|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p251_122|She has been shot.
p251_123|I'm so angry.
p251_124|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p251_125|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p251_126|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p251_127|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p251_128|Well, you can have a tree.
p251_129|It was the same at Twickenham.
p251_130|We had a reunion last week.
p251_131|If not, a deal could take many months.
p251_132|Government will intervene.
p251_133|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p251_134|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p251_135|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p251_136|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p251_137|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p251_138|Is that it?
p251_139|I had decided to quit the show.
p251_140|I am totally devoted to this job.
p251_141|Three penalties were given.
p251_142|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p251_143|We just had a go.
p251_144|We have seen a copy of the report.
p251_145|The songs are just so good.
p251_146|It is like a football team.
p251_147|That group reported just before Christmas.
p251_148|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p251_149|You know the type.
p251_150|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p251_151|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p251_152|He seemed to lose his focus.
p251_153|It is not normal practice.
p251_154|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p251_155|I knew he was good.
p251_156|I saw one body.
p251_157|There's a pause.
p251_158|Neither side can win this war.
p251_159|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p251_160|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p251_161|Eight months later, he was dead.
p251_162|We have to move forward.
p251_163|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p251_164|Tell it like it was?
p251_165|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p251_166|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p251_167|You are not going in blind.
p251_168|The post will be unpaid.
p251_169|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p251_170|They thought they had found a home.
p251_171|I always felt they played for me.
p251_172|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p251_173|One season, they might do well.
p251_174|The jury is still out.
p251_175|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p251_176|It is not either national standards or local control.
p251_177|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p251_178|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p251_179|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p251_180|We knew nothing about it.
p251_181|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p251_182|Four policemen were wounded.
p251_183|We did everything by the book.
p251_184|What has caused the demise of singing?
p251_185|We want to help them through it.
p251_186|I cannot say too much about them.
p251_187|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p251_188|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p251_189|People will ask about us.
p251_190|However, this idea is never developed.
p251_191|Last night was a key episode.
p251_192|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p251_193|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p251_194|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p251_195|It is a case of taking a risk.
p251_196|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p251_197|It wasn't to be.
p251_198|It was typical.
p251_199|It's the same old story.
p251_200|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p251_201|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p251_202|There was no option.
p251_203|The conference is the first test.
p251_204|I saw some terrible things.
p251_205|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p251_206|A deadline is still essential.
p251_207|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p251_208|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p251_209|Today was first class.
p251_210|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p251_211|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p251_212|We have an election in eight days.
p251_213|Now, it's all right.
p251_214|There was an e-mail.
p251_215|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p251_216|Twaddle is a case in point.
p251_217|I began to pray.
p251_218|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p251_219|We have got to get it right.
p251_220|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p251_221|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p251_222|Work has started.
p251_223|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p251_224|It's just a place to open it.
p251_225|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p251_226|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p251_227|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p251_228|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p251_230|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p251_231|We played them off the pitch.
p251_232|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p251_233|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p251_234|I am immensely sad.
p251_235|I'd never seen a play about me.
p251_236|It is a gamble.
p251_237|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p251_238|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p251_239|We were awful.
p251_240|However, no further action was taken by police.
p251_241|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p251_242|They had no children.
p251_243|It is set in Paris.
p251_244|They should come forward.
p251_245|It's quite a line-up!
p251_246|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
p251_247|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p251_248|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p251_249|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p251_250|My future is in the marathon.
p251_251|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p251_252|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p251_253|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p251_254|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p251_255|It is hard won.
p251_256|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p251_257|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p251_258|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p251_259|They tried to give her advice.
p251_260|His body was never found.
p251_262|He's a lovely young man.
p251_263|It was a hit.
p251_264|We are ready.
p251_265|They know no other way.
p251_266|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p251_267|We run within the law.
p251_268|They are interior designers and architects.
p251_269|Kirkwood was arrested.
p251_270|they fail to engage.
p251_271|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p251_272|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p251_273|I was happily surprised.
p251_274|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p251_275|I am very angry.
p251_276|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p251_278|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p251_279|Rehearsals will start in the new year for the extended season.
p251_280|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p251_281|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p251_282|That's the only thing I will say.
p251_283|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p251_284|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p251_285|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p251_286|He has not created a Festival resource.
p251_287|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p251_288|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p251_289|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p251_290|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p251_291|We're in shock.
p251_292|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p251_293|One knows the feeling.
p251_294|Things can change.
p251_295|It's a way of life.
p251_296|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p251_297|I am an estate agent.
p251_298|People have no choice.
p251_299|She looked so young.
p251_300|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p251_301|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p251_302|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p251_303|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p251_304|You've got to have both sides.
p251_305|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p251_306|Who will perform?
p251_307|This is a national crisis.
p251_308|Scotland were beaten again.
p251_309|Who did the recruiting?
p251_310|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p251_311|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p251_312|The results are sometimes contentious.
p251_313|These figures are truly awful.
p251_314|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p251_315|A new school will be built.
p251_316|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p251_317|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p251_318|He said she was mad.
p251_319|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p251_320|Our task is to complete the picture.
p251_321|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p251_322|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p251_323|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p251_324|You are the glory.
p251_325|The letters are going out today.
p251_326|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p251_327|We are a peaceful people.
p251_328|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p251_329|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p251_330|It is out there.
p251_331|They had a confession.
p251_332|However, the groups denied the claims.
p251_333|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p251_334|That's the law of the land.
p251_335|There was no time scale.
p251_336|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p251_337|It's not long enough.
p251_338|I am so upset.
p251_339|He was not a big name.
p251_340|The police have to act to help them.
p251_341|It could have gone either way.
p251_342|Is that an issue?
p251_343|He can do no wrong.
p251_344|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p251_345|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p251_346|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
p251_347|The team for the first game could be this one.
p251_348|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p251_349|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p252_001|Please call Stella.
p252_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p252_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p252_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p252_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p252_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p252_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p252_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p252_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p252_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p252_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p252_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p252_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p252_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p252_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p252_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p252_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p252_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p252_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p252_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p252_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases.
p252_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-position of a number of bows.
p252_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p252_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p252_025|Then nine minutes before half time Kenny Miller struck.
p252_026|This would include insurance.
p252_027|It would fit very well with us.
p252_028|He does not even trust his own members.
p252_029|Do not give your details to anyone.
p252_030|Schools do not create that.
p252_032|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p252_033|Just look at his fashion sense.
p252_034|I have every confidence.
p252_035|He added that her comments were noted.
p252_036|We've got a real battle now with Richard.
p252_037|Instead, we make the ground pay.
p252_038|That time may never be broken.
p252_039|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p252_040|He too started on the subs seats.
p252_041|I'm so happy that she did.
p252_042|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
p252_043|This operation will change her life.
p252_044|Something old something new, as it were.
p252_045|The youngsters have put us in a strong position.
p252_046|They seem too much of a sure thing.
p252_047|That's what set him apart.
p252_048|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p252_050|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p252_051|She continued to enjoy sport.
p252_052|Downing Street also rejected the calls for a European army.
p252_053|By all accounts he was delighted.
p252_054|Schools will not want change.
p252_055|I think I'm a bit too young.
p252_056|He was failed by his health authority.
p252_057|We wish to win, but not at any price.
p252_058|I agree with you about this.
p252_059|Or so he thought.
p252_060|Must be prepared to use it.
p252_061|The fifth was found later.
p252_062|For a decade she was proved right.
p252_063|It was dangerous but vital employment.
p252_064|Our people are ready.
p252_065|These figures cover the major British banking groups.
p252_066|Probably he wasn't thinking at all.
p252_067|Some of their players seemed almost dead.
p252_068|People come to see the Highlands.
p252_069|It would have to be.
p252_071|This is a great opportunity for us.
p252_072|That is not possible.
p252_073|None has ever been found.
p252_074|Insurance will perhaps reduce.
p252_075|Their time has gone.
p252_076|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p252_077|How are you, sir ?
p252_078|So is that it, then ?
p252_079|Do I have a favourite ?
p252_080|What do we do ?
p252_081|Why do it otherwise ?
p252_082|What kind of a man does that, Mr Dick ?
p252_083|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p252_084|He has a real potential.
p252_085|LET there be light.
p252_086|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p252_087|Scotland has great assets.
p252_088|That remains the same.
p252_089|It was exactly four months away.
p252_090|There is no issue of national security involved here.
p252_091|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p252_092|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p252_093|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
p252_094|The car driver died.
p252_095|It looks that way.
p252_096|Now comes the hard part.
p252_097|We are already seeing some positive results.
p252_098|We're at home, which is important.
p252_099|They prepared some food very quickly.
p252_100|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p252_101|In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his primary task.
p252_102|They had three children.
p252_103|Some young girls also came by last night.
p252_104|The idea is the shop within a shop.
p252_105|It would be easy to think so.
p252_106|And so it went on.
p252_108|Scotland were on Saturday.
p252_109|We want the results as soon as possible before Thursday.
p252_110|He gets his moment.
p252_111|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.
p252_112|There was no reason.
p252_113|It gets too much.
p252_114|So they should be.
p252_115|No progress has been made.
p252_116|They need the money.
p252_117|That is the only way to rate players.
p252_118|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p252_119|Its failure is no surprise.
p252_120|No country has a similar training programme.
p252_121|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
p252_122|Consumers will also benefit.
p252_123|They pointed to the site.
p252_124|Tony Blair said as little.
p252_125|He is at peace with himself.
p252_126|Gold admitted as much.
p252_127|It seemed like four hours.
p252_128|Evidence must not be held back.
p252_129|We beat the Welsh team.
p252_130|I saw a lot of good things against Livingston.
p252_131|Britain's role was to stop it.
p252_132|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p252_133|Eight others have followed.
p252_134|We're currently looking at the level of support.
p252_135|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
p252_136|Strong growth is expected from the industrial services division.
p252_137|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
p252_138|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
p252_139|It should have its own network.
p252_140|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
p252_141|But this wasn't the full picture.
p252_142|That shows the impact it had.
p252_143|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
p252_144|I'd always wanted to act.
p252_145|We hope he will do until he finally does the double.
p252_146|That is a big risk at any price.
p252_147|I am never fully fit.
p252_148|Are you going to win ?
p252_149|Was it the wife ?
p252_150|Why change it ?
p252_151|What do we want to do that for ?
p252_152|Does the name matter ?
p252_153|how do you get it back ?
p252_154|What are you not good at ?
p252_155|I think, therefore I am ?
p252_156|Who was she ?
p252_157|He said some things which were better left alone.
p252_158|He nearly killed my son.
p252_160|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
p252_161|I told them during their morning break.
p252_162|Parents of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.
p252_163|Mr Dewar understood that.
p252_164|Nato has left them with no other option.
p252_165|They have shown great character.
p252_166|I am secure in my own position.
p252_167|It wasn't a pretty match.
p252_168|Health experts said they were not surprised by the findings.
p252_169|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
p252_170|The second failed completely.
p252_171|That apart, though, I feel good.
p252_172|We have come a long way since then.
p252_173|Sport is good for you.
p252_174|It was clearly not a battle.
p252_175|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p252_176|You are looking at specialist staff and specialist staff cost money.
p252_177|I'd rather be in our position than Rangers.
p252_178|All options are available.
p252_179|I knew Donald Dewar.
p252_181|Parents do not know very much about drugs.
p252_182|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p252_183|I've no idea how it works.
p252_184|It is actually building on the existing business.
p252_185|Maybe this battle had been.
p252_186|Art can challenge our value system.
p252_187|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p252_188|London remained the favourite.
p252_189|I've never had a year like this.
p252_190|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p252_191|She really suffered for her art.
p252_193|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p252_194|A child is not a product.
p252_195|Which can happen any time.
p252_196|Scottish Life was there over one year.
p252_197|Now he is back on top again.
p252_198|The hotel was huge.
p252_199|And they were being paid ?
p252_200|was everything done to save people ?
p252_201|What was the matter for concern ?
p252_202|Do I think about them often ?
p252_203|Is it in the right place ?
p252_204|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p252_205|This should begin in October.
p252_206|There remains some Scottish influence, however.
p252_207|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
p252_208|The role was perfect for Russell.
p252_209|The price was raised after massive demands from retail investors.
p252_210|If not, a deal could take many months.
p252_211|Their bodies were never found.
p252_212|It plans to return to this field.
p252_213|Business will continue as usual.
p252_214|I want a free vote.
p252_215|Fine, said the press officer.
p252_216|The questions came quick and fast.
p252_217|The Boys can speak about little else.
p252_218|Her experience is certainly limited.
p252_219|We tried four banks.
p252_220|There is no doubt there's room for us.
p252_221|The labour side had developed in the North area.
p252_222|Good records have also been recognised by successful farmers.
p252_223|Brian was last to join.
p252_224|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p252_225|Now the door has opened.
p252_226|I'd rather play well next week than here.
p252_227|Her death is a huge blow.
p252_228|The global market was about flat.
p252_229|Three hit the target.
p252_230|The idea is simple.
p252_231|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
p252_232|It's used by Ayr Technical College.
p252_233|The Queen was on the ball yesterday but off the Euro.
p252_234|We know the problems.
p252_235|Britain will be little affected.
p252_236|There is a good reason for this.
p252_237|You know the type.
p252_238|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p252_239|The board do not own the company.
p252_240|That time is not far away.
p252_241|That's been the difference between the sides.
p252_242|When I was training.
p252_243|I did let myself down a bit.
p252_244|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p252_245|This is absolutely not true.
p252_246|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p252_247|It was a great evening.
p252_248|We have several options.
p252_250|Our focus remains on quality revenue.
p252_251|Perhaps it will happen again.
p252_252|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p252_253|It is based on population rather than need.
p252_254|We were leading by two goals.
p252_255|It had happened on average once a week this year.
p252_256|It is very much in the eye of the individual.
p252_258|It was an accident.
p252_260|My goals have never changed.
p252_262|So we kept them waiting.
p252_263|He makes time for everyone.
p252_264|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p252_265|The proposal was rejected.
p252_266|Look at a computer.
p252_267|He did better then.
p252_268|But the next day she paid for it.
p252_269|We still think this trade is on the increase.
p252_270|It is also hoped big name stars could be brought on board.
p252_271|This was the perfect setting.
p252_273|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
p252_274|The long-term trend is equally clear.
p252_275|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.
p252_276|All films open tomorrow
p252_277|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p252_278|Paul never gave up hope.
p252_279|Those three goals in five minutes changed the game.
p252_280|They bought the property four years ago.
p252_281|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
p252_282|Their only score of the half came from a penalty by Jones.
p252_283|It is a dangerous sport.
p252_284|Oil stocks also provided a boost.
p252_286|The future might well be green after all.
p252_287|They were seriously after him.
p252_288|It was a bit like having children.
p252_289|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p252_290|Donald felt it would be an appropriate thing to do.
p252_291|I'm interested in interesting work.
p252_292|His season started this afternoon.
p252_293|He is a good signing for Rangers.
p252_294|White would like to buy further bus businesses.
p252_295|Kenny and I are ready.
p252_296|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p252_297|He also worked on general building contracts in the area.
p252_298|They have played their part.
p252_299|He followed the Italian route.
p252_300|Stephen had never considered the question of compensation.
p252_301|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p252_302|So does every industry.
p252_303|Tomorrow will be my last.
p252_304|But there's also a love for the songs.
p252_305|His career may also provide food for thought for Ferguson.
p252_306|We must move on.
p252_307|It's just an area of water.
p252_308|We have achieved that.
p252_309|Their eyes, however, told a different story.
p252_310|Good players have become bad.
p252_311|Many events are down on numbers.
p252_312|He had served his time.
p252_313|It was a total surprise.
p252_314|If a service doesn't pay it will go.
p252_315|The process will start tomorrow.
p252_316|Motherwell took them from half chances.
p252_317|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
p252_319|One finding emerged clearly.
p252_320|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
p252_321|We lost to a poor team.
p252_322|We are keen to see truth and justice.
p252_323|We have clearly become well established.
p252_324|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p252_325|Murray plays down return
p252_326|Other teams moved up too.
p252_327|Not one person spoke badly.
p252_328|We were caught out.
p252_329|The performance continues to improve.
p252_330|We want immediate action.
p252_331|Our relationship has been very good.
p252_332|Someone should tell them.
p252_333|But it won't help British farmers.
p252_334|Does that put pressure on us ?
p252_335|Did it work ?
p252_336|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p252_337|Is our children learning ?
p252_338|How independent is that ?
p252_339|Because I think it's there.
p252_340|If we get the wrong candidate.
p252_341|They emerged before the patients left hospital.
p252_342|They will now remain split up.
p252_343|We are a husband and wife team.
p252_344|It was the September weekend after all.
p252_345|He would add value.
p252_346|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.
p252_347|Those overseas offices were great.
p252_348|That was our last chance to do something.
p252_349|Maybe she is right.
p252_350|I saw one man vote five times.
p252_351|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p252_352|No sport needs that sort of thing.
p252_353|The senior management team will be drawn from both companies.
p252_354|Any increase always has some effect.
p252_355|What form did that take ?
p252_356|Are they free ?
p252_357|What are they for ?
p252_358|Is there a waiting list ?
p252_359|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p252_360|They had better be.
p252_361|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p252_362|He was a great human being.
p252_363|That seems highly unlikely.
p252_364|Still, I am delighted.
p252_365|Analysts welcomed the news.
p252_366|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p252_367|You will lose benefit because you have broken the rules.
p252_368|They made such decisions in London.
p252_369|Results of the survey are expected by the end of June.
p252_370|The whole system is too complex.
p252_371|He said legal action could be considered.
p252_372|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
p252_373|This is far too high.
p252_374|These matters can't just be medical decisions.
p252_375|If you believe in the blue and white.
p252_376|We have no information on Iraq.
p252_378|The referee faces a massive job.
p252_379|That could be ready within another nine months.
p252_380|Next league matches Kilmarnock.
p252_381|An appeal was unlikely.
p252_382|He said he had now written to Scottish Industry Minister Lord Macdonald.
p252_383|I got dropped for that game.
p252_384|No real attempt was made to get orders.
p252_385|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p252_386|This year I understood.
p252_387|It's clearly a budget.
p252_388|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
p252_389|The women are victims here.
p252_390|I'm not sure that's right.
p253_001|Please call Stella.
p253_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p253_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p253_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p253_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p253_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p253_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p253_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p253_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p253_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p253_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p253_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p253_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p253_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p253_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p253_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p253_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p253_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p253_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p253_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p253_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p253_025|But it failed.
p253_026|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p253_027|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p253_028|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p253_029|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p253_030|This is the window.
p253_031|He was jailed for five years.
p253_032|Help is needed.
p253_033|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p253_034|It is marvellous.
p253_035|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p253_036|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p253_037|They're just different.
p253_038|It was clear.
p253_039|Indeed, he does.
p253_040|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p253_041|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p253_042|Dancing was her life.
p253_043|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p253_044|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p253_045|They want to be entertained.
p253_046|It's the only thing.
p253_047|You had better believe it.
p253_048|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p253_049|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p253_050|A neighbour said.
p253_051|It is bizarre.
p253_052|There is no reason at all.
p253_053|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p253_054|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p253_055|Our people are ready.
p253_056|Here's a clue.
p253_057|I was lost.
p253_058|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p253_059|My fitness was very poor.
p253_060|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p253_061|It is unique.
p253_062|I expect a rapid response.
p253_063|It happened so quickly.
p253_064|That's the truth.
p253_065|It seems to have worked.
p253_066|This is the first step.
p253_067|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p253_068|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p253_069|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p253_071|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p253_072|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p253_073|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p253_074|It could take some time.
p253_075|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p253_076|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p253_077|It is a job creation scheme.
p253_078|The party is up for it.
p253_079|People must remain vigilant.
p253_080|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p253_081|What has changed?
p253_082|I will miss him.
p253_083|He is in the queue.
p253_084|I first met him last summer.
p253_085|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p253_086|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p253_087|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p253_088|They lived for their children.
p253_089|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p253_090|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p253_091|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p253_092|We are on the path of change.
p253_093|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p253_095|Yet, it worked.
p253_096|He's been hit by it.
p253_097|I love the Dome.
p253_098|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p253_099|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p253_100|It is a love affair.
p253_101|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p253_102|They make a selective perception process.
p253_103|Two of the team became ill.
p253_104|That would be unlawful.
p253_106|Oil embargo endorsed.
p253_107|It was an adventure.
p253_108|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p253_109|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p253_110|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p253_111|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p253_112|Is that right?
p253_113|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p253_114|It's a shame.
p253_115|It was the eighties.
p253_116|It is so sad.
p253_117|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p253_118|The mood is upbeat.
p253_119|It is rubbish.
p253_120|Who would be a referee?
p253_121|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p253_122|We enjoyed it today.
p253_123|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p253_124|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p253_125|There were no grounds for his action.
p253_126|I'm so angry.
p253_127|She really suffered for her art.
p253_128|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p253_129|It's not a U-turn.
p253_130|No production was achieved.
p253_131|I am now unemployed.
p253_132|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
p253_133|It plans to return to this field.
p253_134|We work well together.
p253_135|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p253_136|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p253_138|I was dead.
p253_139|I don't know the full story.
p253_140|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p253_141|She died at her home.
p253_142|He realises his mistake.
p253_143|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p253_144|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p253_145|I was awful.
p253_146|Who would have?
p253_147|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p253_148|It is not just about pay.
p253_149|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p253_150|There was a substantial explosion.
p253_151|I was stunned.
p253_152|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p253_153|The weather forecast isn't good.
p253_154|They have not been named.
p253_156|My Dad is a hero.
p253_157|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p253_158|Words were not required.
p253_160|Life becomes a song.
p253_161|Well, he should know.
p253_162|Was this element always there?
p253_163|These days are long gone.
p253_164|I'd love to be like Peter.
p253_165|I've put my own money into this project.
p253_167|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p253_168|I was in the train station overnight.
p253_169|We have a budget in March.
p253_170|We should do everything at a stroke.
p253_171|You had to go and see him.
p253_173|In a way he was.
p253_175|Blair's response was weak.
p253_176|As we worked.
p253_177|We are the gateway to justice.
p253_178|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p253_179|The goals were good.
p253_180|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p253_181|It's an idea.
p253_182|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p253_183|They need to look after themselves.
p253_184|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p253_185|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p253_186|Does this matter?
p253_187|Our team is just so young.
p253_188|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p253_189|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p253_190|It caused a lot of upset.
p253_191|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p253_192|We speak about the performance.
p253_194|Peace was won.
p253_195|It's a fact.
p253_196|I came home by ambulance.
p253_197|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p253_198|Is that success?
p253_199|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p253_200|Who will pay for this?
p253_201|It's all about money, money, money.
p253_202|Sadly, it can't.
p253_203|It was worth a photograph.
p253_205|We have an election in eight days.
p253_206|Feel the heat?
p253_207|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p253_208|Twaddle is a case in point.
p253_209|It had all been arranged.
p253_211|Work has started.
p253_212|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p253_213|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p253_214|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p253_215|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p253_216|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p253_217|Then another one came.
p253_218|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p253_219|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p253_220|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p253_221|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p253_222|I'd never seen a play about me.
p253_223|It's not before time.
p253_224|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p253_225|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p253_226|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p253_227|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p253_228|My wife and family are the support system.
p253_229|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p253_230|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p253_231|We are so proud.
p253_232|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p253_233|Of course I was tempted.
p253_234|It's quite a line-up!
p253_235|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p253_236|The minister is the engineer.
p253_237|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p253_238|It is hard won.
p253_239|Our policy is clear.
p253_240|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p253_241|The scene is about this?
p253_242|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p253_243|My son was too young to die.
p253_244|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p253_245|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p253_247|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p253_248|That could be in place by next year.
p253_249|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p253_250|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p253_251|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p253_252|they fail to engage.
p253_253|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p253_254|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p253_255|They must play for each other.
p253_256|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p253_257|There's not much money in cycling.
p253_258|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p253_260|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p253_261|He has not created a Festival resource.
p253_262|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p253_263|He was also married with two children.
p253_264|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p253_265|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p253_266|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p253_267|One knows the feeling.
p253_268|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p253_269|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p253_270|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p253_271|She failed in her action.
p253_272|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p253_273|She looked so young.
p253_274|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p253_275|It's so awful.
p253_276|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p253_277|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p253_278|You've got to have both sides.
p253_279|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p253_280|Dialogue is the key.
p253_281|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p253_282|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p253_283|Who will perform?
p253_285|Who did the recruiting?
p253_287|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p253_288|I was the sheep.
p253_289|I was brought up in a mining background.
p253_290|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p253_291|Nothing is safe.
p253_292|But it's a subtle process.
p253_293|One was a lawyer.
p253_294|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p253_296|They are wrong.
p253_297|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p253_298|There were no passengers on board.
p253_299|It could work.
p253_300|This is a war over our home.
p253_301|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p253_302|There's no evidence he was ever there.
p253_303|You should be.
p253_304|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p253_305|The letters are going out today.
p253_307|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p253_308|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p253_309|She is very distinctive.
p253_310|We have got to get the points from this one.
p253_311|You may have a short memory.
p253_313|We are in the end game.
p253_314|It will work.
p253_316|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p253_317|Our message was inclusive.
p253_318|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p253_319|Feel the air, the space.
p253_320|Is there a new way forward?
p253_322|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p253_323|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p253_324|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p253_326|Three years ago he would have been.
p253_327|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p253_328|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p253_329|Two people were interviewed.
p253_330|I've got no secret.
p253_331|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p253_332|This is a friendly match?
p253_333|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p253_334|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p253_335|They should take their mobile phones.
p253_336|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p253_337|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p253_338|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p253_339|She is free.
p253_340|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p253_341|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p253_342|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p253_343|Yet he left a few days later.
p253_344|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p253_345|As, indeed, they would be.
p253_346|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p253_348|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p253_349|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p253_350|That would help.
p253_351|My husband was angry.
p253_352|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p253_354|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p253_355|This is a club on the rise.
p253_356|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p253_357|Their time has gone.
p253_358|He could make it.
p253_359|The death rates are still as high.
p253_360|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p253_361|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p253_363|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p253_364|It is a simple equation.
p253_365|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p253_366|It was a funny game.
p253_367|There wasn't a goal.
p253_368|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p253_369|Colour was at the core of his life.
p253_371|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
p253_372|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p253_373|Something is wrong.
p253_374|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p253_375|That's the name of the game, though.
p253_376|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p253_377|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p253_378|Does that put pressure on us?
p253_379|At the last I found a bunker.
p253_380|Yet the data is compelling.
p253_381|It's a real problem.
p253_382|It's just outrageous.
p253_383|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p253_384|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p254_001|Please call Stella.
p254_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p254_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p254_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p254_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p254_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p254_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p254_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p254_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p254_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p254_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p254_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p254_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p254_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p254_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p254_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p254_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p254_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p254_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p254_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p254_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p254_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p254_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p254_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p254_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p254_026|But it failed.
p254_027|They may be wrong.
p254_028|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p254_029|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p254_030|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p254_031|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p254_032|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p254_033|It's a matter of balance.
p254_034|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p254_035|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p254_037|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p254_038|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p254_039|They're just different.
p254_040|It was clear.
p254_041|It is not for any other purpose.
p254_042|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p254_043|I was scared.
p254_044|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p254_045|No meaningful response was issued.
p254_046|That period was a struggle.
p254_047|I am just going to go for it.
p254_048|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p254_049|This represents a tough game for us.
p254_050|It's a crucial award.
p254_051|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p254_052|That should do it.
p254_053|It's a blessing.
p254_054|Is a drug dealer?
p254_055|But it might have done.
p254_056|That time has passed.
p254_057|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p254_058|He is too weak to move.
p254_059|Life is good.
p254_060|It is the whole package.
p254_061|This is a club on the rise.
p254_062|He had no enemies.
p254_063|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p254_064|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p254_065|That's the day job.
p254_066|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p254_067|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p254_068|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p254_069|My mother is a widow.
p254_070|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p254_071|Jobs could go.
p254_072|Four other charges were dropped.
p254_073|They're appalled by that.
p254_074|There was a battle there.
p254_075|It's good news and long overdue.
p254_076|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p254_077|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p254_078|They never gave up hope.
p254_079|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p254_080|Painful, but only because it's true.
p254_081|It's all I can do.
p254_082|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p254_083|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p254_084|The price cuts are really exciting.
p254_085|My office is bare.
p254_086|Is there a new way forward?
p254_087|There was an e-mail.
p254_088|Even the one she loved.
p254_090|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p254_091|It may well have been.
p254_092|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p254_093|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p254_094|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p254_095|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p254_096|All options are open.
p254_097|You will be.
p254_098|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p254_099|And rugby fans can help.
p254_100|Now the system is right behind us.
p254_101|However, it did not end that way.
p254_102|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
p254_103|The group is due to report by the end of the year.
p254_104|I love the Dome.
p254_105|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p254_106|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p254_107|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p254_108|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p254_109|But it was a pleasure.
p254_110|He takes the job.
p254_111|It was an adventure.
p254_112|That all hope is never lost.
p254_113|And I thought - we have to do something with this.
p254_114|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p254_115|It is normal.
p254_116|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p254_117|We need to handle it.
p254_118|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p254_119|It's a long process.
p254_120|They were behind the wheel.
p254_121|The fire was above the hole.
p254_122|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p254_123|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p254_124|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p254_125|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p254_126|I joined a group.
p254_127|Does this mean.
p254_128|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p254_129|It is a job creation scheme.
p254_130|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p254_131|I'm so angry.
p254_132|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p254_133|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p254_134|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p254_135|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p254_136|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p254_137|It plans to return to this field.
p254_138|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p254_139|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p254_140|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p254_141|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p254_143|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p254_144|Three penalties were given.
p254_145|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p254_146|He is severe.
p254_147|It is difficult for Ali.
p254_148|There is a lack of chemistry.
p254_149|This is the way things should be handled.
p254_150|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p254_151|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p254_152|It is not just about pay.
p254_153|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p254_154|You know the type.
p254_155|The weaknesses are few.
p254_156|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p254_157|I was in daily contact.
p254_158|We will turn the corner.
p254_159|This latter point is hugely important.
p254_160|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p254_161|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p254_162|He's a nice guy.
p254_163|It has to be now.
p254_164|They are not advertised.
p254_165|I have got a wife to feed.
p254_166|Tell it like it was?
p254_167|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p254_168|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p254_169|We started to struggle with each other towards the end.
p254_170|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p254_171|He was a crazy man.
p254_172|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p254_173|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p254_174|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p254_175|It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
p254_176|It is not either national standards or local control.
p254_177|The clarity is vital.
p254_178|The hotel was now for sale.
p254_179|Tony had arrived.
p254_180|He will need that machine.
p254_181|I was totally wrong.
p254_182|We did everything by the book.
p254_183|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p254_184|However, this idea is never developed.
p254_185|I grew up listening to these people.
p254_186|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p254_187|Peace was won.
p254_188|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p254_189|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p254_190|Off I went.
p254_191|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p254_192|Is that it?
p254_193|The conference is the first test.
p254_194|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p254_195|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p254_196|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p254_197|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p254_198|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p254_199|Today was first class.
p254_200|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p254_201|We have an election in eight days.
p254_202|It's like a garage.
p254_203|But I am a worried man.
p254_204|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p254_205|That is an important part of our role.
p254_206|It is a small part, and it's very small in the book.
p254_207|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p254_208|I began to pray.
p254_209|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p254_210|His third goal was superb.
p254_211|It's not ideal.
p254_212|The FBI could become involved.
p254_213|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p254_214|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p254_215|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p254_216|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p254_217|You have to do your research.
p254_218|Saturday is gone.
p254_219|We played them off the pitch.
p254_220|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p254_221|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p254_222|The boy is no longer with us.
p254_223|The track is currently covered in snow.
p254_224|They are the innocent victims.
p254_225|It's so special.
p254_226|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p254_227|At the time, he was a living legend.
p254_228|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p254_229|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p254_230|They tried to give her advice.
p254_231|And thought we would get away with it.
p254_232|We were a load of rubbish.
p254_233|They should come forward.
p254_234|It is not the message alone.
p254_235|He will make a statement on the dispute in the Commons tomorrow.
p254_236|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p254_237|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p254_238|But it's a subtle process.
p254_239|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p254_240|My future is in the marathon.
p254_241|They are all bright and different.
p254_242|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p254_243|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p254_244|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p254_245|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p254_246|He got the same story.
p254_247|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p254_248|I was shocked.
p254_249|He's a lovely young man.
p254_250|There's the mix.
p254_251|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p254_252|This year I understood.
p254_253|That could be in place by next year.
p254_254|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p254_255|It's a source of deep concern.
p254_256|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p254_257|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p254_258|The pensioners did not want to know.
p254_259|It is also very valuable.
p254_260|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p254_261|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p254_262|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p254_263|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p254_264|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p254_265|There is no link.
p254_266|This is a question of Islam.
p254_267|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p254_268|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p254_269|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p254_270|It was an easy decision to come here.
p254_271|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p254_272|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p254_273|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p254_275|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p254_276|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p254_277|It's a way of life.
p254_278|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p254_279|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p254_280|People have no choice.
p254_281|If not, he should go home.
p254_282|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p254_283|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p254_284|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p254_285|I saw it at a ruck.
p254_286|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p254_287|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p254_288|He will address the nation this evening.
p254_289|The mood is good.
p254_290|It's like a high school play.
p254_291|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p254_292|This is a national crisis.
p254_293|Well, he can do it.
p254_294|These figures are truly awful.
p254_295|That could change.
p254_296|Who can predict?
p254_297|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p254_298|One was a lawyer.
p254_299|It is a road of death.
p254_300|The plot is minimal.
p254_301|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p254_302|I did not name it.
p254_303|We have waited a long time for this.
p254_304|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p254_305|They were fantastic.
p254_306|We are a peaceful people.
p254_307|Craig is a major concern for us.
p254_308|The problems began a long time ago.
p254_309|My body is clearly capable.
p254_310|It is out there.
p254_311|He said she was mad.
p254_312|In the old days, it was easy.
p254_313|We are in the end game.
p254_314|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p254_315|It is a strong case.
p254_316|The parents will have a great time, too.
p254_317|Donald was his friend.
p254_318|He was not a big name.
p254_319|The police have to act to help them.
p254_320|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p254_321|The boat was fantastic.
p254_322|It's not long enough.
p254_323|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
p254_324|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p254_326|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p254_327|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p254_329|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p254_330|They haven't got a hope.
p254_331|It has moved on in the last week.
p254_332|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p254_333|Today she has been released.
p254_334|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p254_335|It should be a great game, though.
p254_336|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p254_337|It should be scrapped.
p254_338|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p254_339|It was good for us that they lost that day.
p254_340|They should take their mobile phones.
p254_341|It is not like working for a living.
p254_342|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p254_343|It is long gone.
p254_344|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p254_345|Tell us about it.
p254_346|It's all going to clear the debt.
p254_347|That is a break with tradition.
p254_348|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p254_349|It was very formal.
p254_350|I kept going for her.
p254_351|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p254_352|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p254_353|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p254_354|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p254_355|We will be homeless.
p254_356|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p254_357|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p254_358|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p254_359|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p254_360|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p254_361|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p254_362|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
p254_363|There was no option.
p254_364|It's now down in black and white.
p254_365|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p254_366|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p254_367|They received a reply from their own managers.
p254_368|But I managed.
p254_369|Five members were disciplined.
p254_370|Talks are progressing.
p254_371|They play together perfectly.
p254_372|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p254_373|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p254_374|It became a national network.
p254_375|It is a large number.
p254_376|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p254_377|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p254_378|He has the edge.
p254_379|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p254_380|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p254_381|Face to face
p254_382|I am very happy with life.
p254_383|I'm just enjoying every match.
p255_001|Please call Stella.
p255_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p255_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p255_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p255_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p255_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p255_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p255_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p255_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p255_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p255_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p255_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p255_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p255_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p255_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p255_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p255_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p255_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p255_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p255_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p255_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p255_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p255_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p255_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p255_025|He has not been named.
p255_026|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p255_027|They should be so lucky.
p255_028|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p255_029|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p255_030|Life was like a timetable.
p255_031|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p255_032|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p255_033|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p255_034|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p255_035|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p255_036|We do not expect any surplus.
p255_037|Dancing was her life.
p255_038|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p255_039|It is a memorial.
p255_040|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p255_041|But it might have done.
p255_042|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p255_043|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
p255_044|I felt really good until Friday.
p255_045|She looked so young.
p255_046|Life is good.
p255_047|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p255_048|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p255_049|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p255_050|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p255_051|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
p255_052|It's very odd.
p255_053|Because we do not need it.
p255_054|That's the truth.
p255_055|My mother is a widow.
p255_057|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p255_058|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p255_059|Equity declined to comment.
p255_060|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p255_061|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p255_062|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p255_063|We should have known.
p255_064|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p255_065|The end result is precisely the same.
p255_066|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p255_067|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p255_068|There could be a way back.
p255_069|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p255_070|Then followed a bout of flu.
p255_071|Ferguson should take note.
p255_072|It works for us.
p255_073|He is now resident in England.
p255_074|I've got the shirt.
p255_075|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p255_076|What has changed?
p255_077|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p255_078|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p255_079|He is driven.
p255_080|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p255_081|We have other options.
p255_082|We want to know about the policy.
p255_083|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p255_084|It's never too late.
p255_085|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p255_086|We do not get that impression now.
p255_087|It is a lifeline.
p255_088|However, it did not end that way.
p255_089|They've got to account for it.
p255_090|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p255_091|Until you hit the big games.
p255_092|We could not get any possession.
p255_093|If you could find it.
p255_094|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p255_095|It is a delight on every level.
p255_096|Get to know him.
p255_097|May not have been at fault?
p255_098|I had a ball today.
p255_099|Two of the team became ill.
p255_100|That time is not now, however.
p255_101|Oil embargo endorsed.
p255_102|Scotland were beaten again.
p255_103|Before the game we went for a pint.
p255_104|Further protests are likely.
p255_105|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p255_106|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p255_107|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p255_108|He was jailed for a year.
p255_109|I came to complete.
p255_110|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p255_111|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p255_112|Maybe this battle has been.
p255_113|I'm delighted about that.
p255_114|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p255_115|I joined a group.
p255_116|Does this mean.
p255_117|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p255_118|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p255_119|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p255_120|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p255_121|I can't even get into the A team.
p255_122|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p255_123|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p255_124|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p255_125|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p255_126|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p255_127|It will be too hot.
p255_128|The role was perfect for Russell.
p255_129|If not, a deal could take many months.
p255_130|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p255_131|Our intentions are real.
p255_132|It is also well received.
p255_133|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
p255_134|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p255_135|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p255_136|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p255_137|I saw some terrible things.
p255_138|It's a question of fashion.
p255_139|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p255_140|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p255_141|We have got to get it right.
p255_142|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p255_143|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p255_144|Who would be right?
p255_145|She died at her home.
p255_146|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p255_147|I was awful.
p255_148|The idea is simple.
p255_149|It is like a football team.
p255_150|It would be a last resort.
p255_151|He sets the nature of his Parliament in simple, realistic context.
p255_152|It is not just about pay.
p255_153|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p255_154|We shall not be moved.
p255_155|The weaknesses are few.
p255_156|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p255_157|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p255_158|The first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p255_159|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p255_160|Work has started.
p255_161|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p255_162|And sooner than we may think.
p255_163|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p255_164|It is so unfair.
p255_165|I will tell you.
p255_166|Eight months later, he was dead.
p255_167|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p255_168|We have to move forward.
p255_169|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p255_170|I lost my head.
p255_171|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p255_172|He is keen to stay in public service.
p255_173|You are not going in blind.
p255_174|They will do their own thing.
p255_175|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p255_176|You had to go and see him.
p255_177|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p255_178|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p255_179|His team management was protective.
p255_180|Is Saddam a threat?
p255_181|The jury is still out.
p255_182|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p255_183|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p255_184|And I saw the light!
p255_185|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p255_186|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p255_187|Tony had arrived.
p255_188|It is the whole package.
p255_189|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p255_190|The goals were good.
p255_191|There is no point in looking any further.
p255_192|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p255_193|Four policemen were wounded.
p255_194|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p255_195|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p255_196|They are now divorced.
p255_197|I cannot say too much about them.
p255_198|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p255_199|However, this idea is never developed.
p255_200|It is a farce.
p255_201|I am totally surprised.
p255_202|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p255_203|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p255_204|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p255_205|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p255_206|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p255_207|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p255_208|It's just awful.
p255_209|It's all about money, money, money.
p255_210|It was worth a photograph.
p255_211|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p255_212|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p255_213|We'll have to work hard today.
p255_214|He knows a lot.
p255_215|That is an important part of our role.
p255_216|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p255_217|I had relied on him.
p255_218|I had decided to quit the show.
p255_219|His third goal was superb.
p255_220|It's been a good year.
p255_221|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p255_222|It's not ideal.
p255_223|The FBI could become involved.
p255_224|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p255_225|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p255_226|His death was a tragic accident.
p255_227|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p255_228|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
p255_229|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p255_230|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p255_231|Mental health is a massive issue.
p255_232|We played them off the pitch.
p255_233|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p255_234|Our numbers are small.
p255_235|They are the innocent victims.
p255_236|It's like a basketball.
p255_237|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p255_238|At the time, he was a living legend.
p255_239|It's the same as Glasgow.
p255_240|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p255_241|It is mainstream.
p255_242|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p255_243|We were awful.
p255_244|They had no children.
p255_245|It is set in Paris.
p255_246|It is not the message alone.
p255_247|It's quite a line-up!
p255_248|It has been declared.
p255_249|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p255_250|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p255_251|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p255_252|It's only fair.
p255_253|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p255_254|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p255_255|His body was never found.
p255_256|There's the mix.
p255_257|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
p255_258|I can't get a job.
p255_259|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p255_260|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p255_261|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p255_262|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p255_263|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p255_264|I am very angry.
p255_265|They must play for each other.
p255_266|He can do everything.
p255_267|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p255_268|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p255_269|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p255_270|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p255_271|It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
p255_272|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p255_273|This is a question of Islam.
p255_274|It looks as though he will be right.
p255_275|He was popular.
p255_276|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p255_277|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p255_278|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p255_279|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p255_280|One knows the feeling.
p255_281|He promised to lead from the front in battle for entry.
p255_282|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p255_283|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p255_284|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p255_285|This is a national crisis.
p255_286|The death toll included five children.
p255_287|My body is clearly capable.
p255_288|So I did.
p255_289|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p255_290|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p255_292|These figures are truly awful.
p255_293|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p255_294|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p255_295|Who can predict?
p255_296|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p255_297|A new school will be built.
p255_298|I have tonight resigned as member of the European Commission.
p255_299|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p255_300|Graeme was prepared.
p255_301|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p255_302|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p255_303|Our task is to complete the picture.
p255_304|they fail to engage.
p255_305|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p255_306|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p255_307|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p255_308|It's certainly different.
p255_309|Is there on his hands?
p255_310|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p255_311|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p255_312|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p255_313|I never thought it would take this long.
p255_314|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p255_315|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p255_316|Henman has been warned.
p255_317|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p255_318|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
p255_319|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p255_320|Referees are easy targets.
p255_321|There was some merit in that.
p255_322|I came into this world with nothing.
p255_323|That's the law of the land.
p255_324|They will be destroyed.
p255_325|It is a strong case.
p255_326|My view has now completely changed.
p255_327|The police have to act to help them.
p255_328|We agreed to disagree.
p255_329|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p255_330|It could have gone either way.
p255_331|It is a time bomb.
p255_332|I'd like to take the plunge.
p255_333|It can be halted.
p255_334|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
p255_335|They haven't got a hope.
p255_336|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p255_337|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p255_338|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
p255_339|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p255_340|Look at the witnesses.
p255_341|Nobody else was with me.
p255_342|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p255_343|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p255_344|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p255_345|This is a friendly match?
p255_346|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p255_347|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p255_348|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p255_349|That is a break with tradition.
p255_350|I kept going for her.
p255_351|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p255_352|He's very explosive.
p255_353|I was in the train station overnight.
p255_354|It benefits the whole family.
p255_355|It was one in the afternoon.
p255_356|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p255_357|We will be homeless.
p255_358|It was fit for royalty.
p255_359|We are looking for perfection.
p255_360|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p255_361|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p256_001|Please call Stella.
p256_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p256_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p256_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p256_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p256_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p256_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p256_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p256_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p256_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p256_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p256_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p256_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p256_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p256_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p256_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p256_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p256_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p256_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p256_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p256_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p256_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p256_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p256_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p256_025|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p256_026|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p256_027|I have a theory.
p256_028|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p256_029|There's a story, too.
p256_030|I was an athlete.
p256_031|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p256_032|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p256_033|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p256_034|A web site is planned for November.
p256_035|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p256_036|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p256_037|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p256_038|They're just different.
p256_039|It's a real threat.
p256_040|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p256_041|It had been played at festivals.
p256_042|Indeed, he does.
p256_043|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p256_044|This film will be totally awesome.
p256_045|No meaningful response was issued.
p256_046|That period was a struggle.
p256_047|A neighbour said.
p256_048|It's a crucial award.
p256_049|It is difficult for Ali.
p256_050|It's a blessing.
p256_051|Is a drug dealer?
p256_052|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p256_053|I would love to have him home.
p256_054|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p256_055|He had no enemies.
p256_056|Sadly, it can't.
p256_057|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p256_058|It is unique.
p256_059|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p256_060|That's the truth.
p256_061|That is very hard, alone.
p256_062|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p256_063|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p256_064|And a film maker was born.
p256_065|It's a matter of balance.
p256_066|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p256_067|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p256_068|They may yet have the last laugh.
p256_069|There was a battle there.
p256_070|They are real.
p256_071|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p256_072|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p256_073|It should be devolved.
p256_074|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p256_075|I was as strong as a horse.
p256_076|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p256_077|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p256_078|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p256_079|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p256_080|It is a terrible place.
p256_081|I've got the shirt.
p256_082|This is the way things should be handled.
p256_083|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p256_084|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p256_085|It may well have been.
p256_086|I first met him last summer.
p256_087|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p256_088|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p256_089|It's never too late.
p256_090|It was nice.
p256_091|We do not get that impression now.
p256_092|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p256_093|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p256_094|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
p256_095|We must look forward.
p256_096|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p256_097|They've got to account for it.
p256_098|She told The Herald.
p256_099|It was clear.
p256_100|There was no rescue.
p256_101|We could not get any possession.
p256_102|They are now divorced.
p256_103|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
p256_104|Journalists should make him.
p256_105|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p256_106|Get to know him.
p256_107|But it was a pleasure.
p256_108|We have every respect for Michelle.
p256_109|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p256_110|I didn't play well last year.
p256_111|Before the game we went for a pint.
p256_112|They will want to perform well.
p256_113|It's not perfect.
p256_114|It was the eighties.
p256_115|They were behind the wheel.
p256_116|This is a step backwards.
p256_117|It was ugly.
p256_118|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p256_119|I joined a group.
p256_120|It is rubbish.
p256_121|Who would be a referee?
p256_122|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p256_123|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p256_124|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p256_125|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p256_126|There were no grounds for his action.
p256_127|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p256_128|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p256_129|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p256_130|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p256_131|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p256_132|Well, you can have a tree.
p256_133|Who will attend?
p256_134|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p256_135|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p256_136|Our intentions are real.
p256_137|It is also well received.
p256_138|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p256_139|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p256_140|It was very frightened and dirty.
p256_141|We want to keep the pound.
p256_142|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p256_143|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p256_144|It changed my life.
p256_145|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p256_146|It is not just about pay.
p256_147|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p256_148|I was so nervous.
p256_149|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p256_150|They have not been named.
p256_151|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p256_152|We should be clear about the role of government.
p256_153|It was by the numbers.
p256_154|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p256_155|We will turn the corner.
p256_156|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p256_157|He can do no wrong.
p256_158|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p256_159|These days are long gone.
p256_160|I will tell you.
p256_161|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p256_162|It has to be now.
p256_163|We have to move forward.
p256_164|They are not advertised.
p256_165|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p256_166|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p256_167|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p256_168|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p256_169|The post will be unpaid.
p256_170|Does that put pressure on us?
p256_171|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p256_172|It is too much for me.
p256_173|We've made a couple of albums.
p256_174|It is not either national standards or local control.
p256_175|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p256_176|The hotel was now for sale.
p256_177|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p256_178|They took a risk.
p256_179|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p256_180|There is no point in looking any further.
p256_181|Nothing is safe.
p256_182|They will run a mile.
p256_183|Four policemen were wounded.
p256_184|They receive a high profile in the media.
p256_185|We did everything by the book.
p256_186|They need to look after themselves.
p256_187|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p256_188|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p256_189|It is a terrible loss.
p256_190|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p256_191|If the director is with you.
p256_192|I am totally surprised.
p256_193|I grew up listening to these people.
p256_194|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p256_195|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p256_196|It is a case of taking a risk.
p256_197|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p256_198|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p256_199|People acted too quickly.
p256_200|I have a cold.
p256_201|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p256_202|Tommy is not a problem.
p256_203|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p256_204|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p256_205|But she might be.
p256_206|It was worth a photograph.
p256_207|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p256_208|It's like a garage.
p256_209|But I am a worried man.
p256_210|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p256_211|She should not be blamed.
p256_212|It had all been arranged.
p256_213|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p256_214|The FBI could become involved.
p256_215|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p256_216|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p256_217|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p256_218|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p256_219|We've got the bronze.
p256_220|It's so special.
p256_221|We will be victorious.
p256_222|He seemed to lose his focus.
p256_223|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p256_224|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p256_225|I am immensely sad.
p256_226|It is a gamble.
p256_227|My neighbours are horrified.
p256_228|The track is currently covered in snow.
p256_229|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p256_230|They are the innocent victims.
p256_231|My wife and family are the support system.
p256_232|The body follows the mind.
p256_233|It is set in Paris.
p256_234|It's quite nice.
p256_235|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p256_236|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p256_237|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p256_238|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p256_239|He was good, but not that good.
p256_240|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
p256_241|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p256_242|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p256_243|It is hard won.
p256_244|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p256_245|The scene is about this?
p256_246|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
p256_247|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p256_248|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p256_249|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p256_250|It was a hit.
p256_251|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p256_252|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p256_253|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p256_254|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p256_255|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p256_256|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p256_257|Chelsea was a great club.
p256_258|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p256_259|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p256_260|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p256_261|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p256_262|I am very angry.
p256_263|The pensioners did not want to know.
p256_264|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
p256_265|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
p256_266|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p256_267|That's the only thing I will say.
p256_268|It looks as though he will be right.
p256_269|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p256_270|He has not created a Festival resource.
p256_271|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p256_272|It was an easy decision to come here.
p256_273|And Michael was just great.
p256_274|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p256_275|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p256_276|I am an estate agent.
p256_277|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p256_278|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p256_279|It happens from time to time.
p256_280|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p256_281|But I've won both ways.
p256_282|I saw it at a ruck.
p256_283|The attacker died in the crash.
p256_284|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p256_285|It's like a high school play.
p256_286|Scotland were beaten again.
p256_287|It's very safe.
p256_288|He was obviously very genuine.
p256_289|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p256_290|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p256_291|He wrote the letter two days before he died.
p256_292|The results are sometimes contentious.
p256_293|The songs are just so good.
p256_294|Who can predict?
p256_295|They are a total disgrace to the loyalist cause.
p256_296|It became a book by itself.
p256_297|The home was now under new management.
p256_298|I thought it was my only chance.
p256_300|One was a lawyer.
p257_001|Please call Stella.
p257_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p257_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p257_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p257_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p257_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p257_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p257_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p257_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p257_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p257_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p257_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p257_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p257_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p257_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p257_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p257_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p257_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p257_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p257_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p257_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p257_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p257_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p257_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p257_025|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p257_026|Is this accurate?
p257_027|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p257_028|Because we do not need it.
p257_029|Life was like a timetable.
p257_030|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p257_031|It was clear.
p257_032|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p257_033|I came to complete.
p257_034|President Bush is at war.
p257_035|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p257_036|I was scared.
p257_037|It was ugly.
p257_038|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p257_039|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
p257_040|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p257_041|A neighbour said.
p257_042|We need to chat.
p257_043|The boy is no longer with us.
p257_044|I hate the word.
p257_045|That should do it.
p257_046|It's a blessing.
p257_047|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p257_048|As she explains.
p257_049|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p257_050|He had no enemies.
p257_051|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p257_052|But the law is very clear on this.
p257_053|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p257_054|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p257_055|Next league matches Celtic.
p257_056|It's very odd.
p257_057|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p257_058|It is not great art.
p257_059|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p257_060|There was a battle there.
p257_061|Scotland had great assets.
p257_062|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p257_063|Have a look at our accounts.
p257_064|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p257_065|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p257_066|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p257_067|It's all I can do.
p257_068|There could be a way back.
p257_069|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p257_070|The price cuts are really exciting.
p257_071|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p257_072|I had my suspicions.
p257_073|She died in hospital two hours later.
p257_074|It was chaotic.
p257_075|Is there a new way forward?
p257_076|I've not thought about it.
p257_077|People must remain vigilant.
p257_078|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p257_079|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p257_080|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p257_081|It may well have been.
p257_082|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p257_083|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p257_084|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p257_085|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p257_086|It's never too late.
p257_087|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p257_088|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p257_089|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p257_090|Today I couldn't run on it.
p257_091|We must look forward.
p257_092|It is an old family habit.
p257_093|He was possessed
p257_094|She told The Herald.
p257_095|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p257_096|The peace process will be buried!
p257_097|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p257_098|They are now divorced.
p257_099|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p257_100|It was mayhem.
p257_101|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p257_102|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p257_103|We have every respect for Michelle.
p257_104|That time is not now, however.
p257_105|I didn't play well last year.
p257_106|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p257_107|They will want to perform well.
p257_108|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p257_109|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p257_110|It is normal.
p257_111|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p257_112|I don't have many friends.
p257_113|It's a shame.
p257_114|It was the eighties.
p257_115|We do not expect any surplus.
p257_116|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p257_117|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p257_118|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p257_119|I'm delighted about that.
p257_120|Does this mean.
p257_121|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p257_122|He did his job.
p257_123|You can spend money on housing.
p257_124|That's all right then.
p257_125|I was furious.
p257_126|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p257_127|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p257_128|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p257_129|So the European elections are extremely important.
p257_130|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p257_131|Who will attend?
p257_132|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p257_133|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p257_134|I am now unemployed.
p257_135|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p257_136|They made such decisions in London.
p257_137|Our intentions are real.
p257_138|It is also well received.
p257_139|What will happen then?
p257_140|It's not true.
p257_141|I feel very grateful with everything.
p257_142|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p257_143|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p257_144|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p257_145|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p257_146|There is a lack of chemistry.
p257_147|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p257_148|It is like a football team.
p257_149|That group reported just before Christmas.
p257_150|He will emerge as a world leader.
p257_151|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p257_152|They did very well.
p257_153|It became a book by itself.
p257_154|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p257_155|The weather forecast isn't good.
p257_156|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p257_157|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p257_158|There's a pause.
p257_159|He can do no wrong.
p257_160|It was so new, so exciting.
p257_161|I've learned from my mistakes.
p257_162|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p257_163|I've put my own money into this project.
p257_164|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p257_165|I lost my head.
p257_166|You are not going in blind.
p257_167|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p257_168|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p257_169|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p257_170|My life has been destroyed.
p257_171|There was no hint of scandal.
p257_172|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p257_173|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p257_174|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p257_175|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p257_176|It's quite a routine.
p257_177|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p257_178|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p257_179|Everyone can be bought.
p257_180|It is minute.
p257_181|They need to look after themselves.
p257_182|What has caused the demise of singing?
p257_183|One was a lawyer.
p257_184|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p257_185|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p257_186|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p257_187|Saturday is gone.
p257_188|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p257_189|Last night was a key episode.
p257_190|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p257_191|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p257_192|Off I went.
p257_193|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p257_194|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p257_195|Ferguson should take note.
p257_196|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p257_197|It's just awful.
p257_198|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p257_199|IT S all in the hair.
p257_200|We have an election in eight days.
p257_201|But I am a worried man.
p257_202|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p257_203|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p257_204|He knows a lot.
p257_205|He is slightly confused.
p257_206|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p257_207|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p257_208|I am delighted for Simon.
p257_209|It had all been arranged.
p257_210|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p257_211|We have got to get it right.
p257_212|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p257_213|I might come back.
p257_214|His death was a tragic accident.
p257_215|It's just a place to open it.
p257_216|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p257_217|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p257_218|William Hague delighted his party.
p257_219|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p257_220|We played them off the pitch.
p257_221|She really suffered for her art.
p257_222|He demanded to speak to the boss.
p257_223|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p257_224|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p257_225|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p257_226|Broke the birdie record.
p257_227|They had no children.
p257_228|It is set in Paris.
p257_229|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p257_230|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p257_231|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p257_232|John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, will fly to the summit tomorrow.
p257_233|But it's a subtle process.
p257_234|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p257_235|My future is in the marathon.
p257_236|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p257_237|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p257_238|They may yet have the last laugh.
p257_239|You can feel at home in China.
p257_240|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p257_241|I should think so, too.
p257_242|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p257_243|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
p257_244|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p257_245|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p257_246|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
p257_247|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p257_248|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p257_249|I watched a game.
p257_250|They are interior designers and architects.
p257_251|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p257_252|they fail to engage.
p257_253|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p257_254|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p257_255|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p257_256|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
p257_257|Blood samples were taken.
p257_258|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p257_259|It's very nice.
p257_260|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p257_261|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p257_262|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p257_263|And Michael was just great.
p257_264|We're in shock.
p257_265|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p257_266|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p257_267|One knows the feeling.
p257_268|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p257_269|She looked so young.
p257_270|It was a privilege to work for him.
p257_271|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p257_272|He looked very sharp.
p257_273|You've got to have both sides.
p257_274|Who did the recruiting?
p257_275|Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
p257_276|Well, he can do it.
p257_277|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p257_278|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p257_279|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p257_280|The results are sometimes contentious.
p257_281|He should have won.
p257_282|A new school will be built.
p257_283|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p257_284|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p257_285|What has altered?
p257_286|The home was now under new management.
p257_287|Graeme was prepared.
p257_288|I thought it was my only chance.
p257_289|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p257_290|It just came into my head that day.
p257_291|They are wrong.
p257_292|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p257_293|It's just not funny!
p257_294|I am very happy to be here.
p257_295|The plot is minimal.
p257_296|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p257_297|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p257_298|This is the culture change in medicine.
p257_299|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p257_300|They were fantastic.
p257_301|I never thought it would take this long.
p257_302|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p257_303|They wanted the club to make money.
p257_304|Kids are terrible.
p257_305|Henman has been warned.
p257_306|It should be equal.
p257_307|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p257_308|The home team had an amazing start.
p257_309|It is out there.
p257_310|They had a confession.
p257_311|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p257_312|We are in the end game.
p257_313|I came into this world with nothing.
p257_314|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p257_315|I am so upset.
p257_316|The boat was fantastic.
p257_317|I saw some good things.
p257_318|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p257_319|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p257_320|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p257_321|Three years ago he would have been.
p257_322|You feel the pride.
p257_323|It is so unfair.
p257_324|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p257_325|Indeed, it was magical.
p257_326|I've got no secret.
p257_327|Look at the witnesses.
p257_328|I'm very lucky.
p257_329|We must do something.
p257_330|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p257_331|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p257_332|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p257_333|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p257_334|It is not like working for a living.
p257_335|It is long gone.
p257_336|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p257_337|Tell us about it.
p257_338|The salary changes are long overdue.
p257_339|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p257_340|It was very formal.
p257_341|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p257_342|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p257_343|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
p257_344|I wanted to go out on a high.
p257_345|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p257_346|I felt really good until Friday.
p257_347|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p257_348|He could face a jail sentence.
p257_349|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p257_350|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p257_351|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p257_352|Then followed a bout of flu.
p257_353|There is no signature.
p257_354|It's a long process.
p257_355|It is a large number.
p257_356|He knew his job inside out.
p257_357|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p257_358|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p257_359|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p257_360|I haven't had a kick at a Celtic player for a while.
p257_361|He has the edge.
p257_362|He denied the charge.
p257_363|There were no casualties.
p257_364|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p257_365|YOU thought it was a headache.
p257_366|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p257_367|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p257_368|They really did a great job.
p257_369|There is a solution, she believes.
p257_370|However, it's good to turn the page.
p257_371|This year I understood.
p257_372|I'm pleased about one thing.
p257_373|It is unusual.
p257_374|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p257_375|It is likely the rest of the market will follow suit.
p257_376|I can lead by example.
p257_377|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p257_378|They are good.
p257_379|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p257_380|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p257_381|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p257_382|It was on fire.
p257_383|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p257_384|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p257_385|Emotions were complex.
p257_386|He's already made history.
p257_387|So I did.
p257_388|You ask the question.
p257_389|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p257_390|There was no trouble.
p257_391|This is a huge confidence boost.
p257_392|Not because they want to sing about something.
p257_393|It is not a standing army.
p257_394|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
p257_395|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p257_396|You wanted the evidence.
p257_397|Our numbers are small.
p257_398|I was very young.
p257_399|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p257_400|I am the Son of Sam.
p257_401|She is superb.
p257_402|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
p257_403|It doesn't always work that way.
p257_404|It is simple, but profound.
p257_405|No preference emerged.
p257_406|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
p257_407|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p257_408|She has reached the top of her profession.
p257_409|It goes with the job.
p257_410|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p257_411|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p257_412|I recommend a tour.
p257_413|We are delighted with this outcome.
p257_414|I have so much respect for him.
p258_001|Please call Stella.
p258_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p258_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p258_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p258_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p258_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p258_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p258_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p258_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p258_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p258_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p258_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p258_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p258_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p258_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p258_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p258_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p258_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p258_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p258_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p258_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p258_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p258_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p258_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p258_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p258_026|It's nice to hear.
p258_027|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p258_028|They should be so lucky.
p258_029|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
p258_030|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p258_031|Because we do not need it.
p258_032|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p258_033|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p258_034|I'd like to continue that record.
p258_035|It was clear.
p258_036|It is not for any other purpose.
p258_037|President Bush is at war.
p258_038|I was scared.
p258_039|It will come all right.
p258_040|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p258_041|The judge said.
p258_042|We need to chat.
p258_043|It's a blessing.
p258_044|As she explains.
p258_045|She looked so young.
p258_046|He looks like an Afghan.
p258_047|It is the whole package.
p258_048|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p258_049|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p258_050|That's the day job.
p258_051|We have not given up hope.
p258_052|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p258_053|That is very hard, alone.
p258_054|It's that kind of place.
p258_055|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p258_056|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p258_057|He was popular.
p258_058|It should be devolved.
p258_059|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p258_060|Try to save us.
p258_061|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p258_062|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p258_063|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p258_064|That was the easy election.
p258_065|It's all I can do.
p258_066|The price cuts are really exciting.
p258_067|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p258_068|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p258_069|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p258_070|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p258_071|He got the same story.
p258_072|This is the way things should be handled.
p258_073|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p258_074|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p258_075|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p258_076|I first met him last summer.
p258_077|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p258_078|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p258_079|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p258_080|We have other options.
p258_081|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p258_082|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p258_083|Today I couldn't run on it.
p258_084|They are different types.
p258_085|It is a simple equation.
p258_086|Until you hit the big games.
p258_087|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p258_088|There was no rescue.
p258_089|She's got to say something.
p258_090|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p258_091|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p258_092|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p258_093|Journalists should make him.
p258_094|But it was a pleasure.
p258_095|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p258_096|Oil embargo endorsed.
p258_097|It is a good lifestyle.
p258_098|Before the game we went for a pint.
p258_099|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p258_100|It's not perfect.
p258_101|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p258_102|She has been shot.
p258_103|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p258_104|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p258_105|We do not expect any surplus.
p258_106|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p258_107|It is so sad.
p258_108|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p258_109|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p258_110|This film will be totally awesome.
p258_111|Maybe this battle has been.
p258_112|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p258_113|I joined a group.
p258_114|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
p258_115|Who would have?
p258_116|It is a delight on every level.
p258_117|You can spend money on housing.
p258_118|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p258_119|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p258_120|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p258_121|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p258_122|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p258_123|She does not want to speak.
p258_124|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p258_125|So the European elections are extremely important.
p258_126|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p258_127|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p258_128|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p258_129|The move has provoked a mixed response.
p258_130|The role was perfect for Russell.
p258_131|It plans to return to this field.
p258_132|They made such decisions in London.
p258_133|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p258_134|My conscience is not clear.
p258_135|I am totally devoted to this job.
p258_136|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p258_137|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p258_138|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p258_139|Is that Titanic?
p258_140|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p258_141|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p258_142|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p258_143|You know the type.
p258_144|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p258_145|The FBI could become involved.
p258_146|The weather forecast isn't good.
p258_147|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p258_148|My Dad is a hero.
p258_149|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p258_150|Neither side can win this war.
p258_151|Was this element always there?
p258_152|These days are long gone.
p258_153|I've put my own money into this project.
p258_154|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p258_155|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p258_156|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p258_157|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p258_158|We have to move forward.
p258_159|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p258_160|We try to keep it right.
p258_161|It's that sort of night.
p258_162|I lost my head.
p258_163|It is not too late to get on board.
p258_164|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p258_165|That will do for me.
p258_166|They thought they had found a home.
p258_167|I always felt they played for me.
p258_168|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p258_169|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p258_170|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p258_171|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p258_172|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p258_173|It should be easy.
p258_174|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p258_175|I drove the ball well.
p258_176|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p258_177|I've been there.
p258_178|They will run a mile.
p258_179|Four policemen were wounded.
p258_180|They receive a high profile in the media.
p258_181|We did everything by the book.
p258_182|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p258_183|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p258_184|We want to help them through it.
p258_185|It is a terrible loss.
p258_186|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p258_187|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p258_188|If the director is with you.
p258_189|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p258_190|I grew up listening to these people.
p258_191|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p258_192|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p258_193|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p258_194|It's the same old story.
p258_195|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p258_196|Is that success?
p258_197|Ferguson should take note.
p258_198|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p258_199|But she might be.
p258_200|A deadline is still essential.
p258_201|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p258_202|It was worth a photograph.
p258_203|It's a mixture of everything.
p258_204|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p258_205|We have an election in eight days.
p258_206|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p258_207|Feel the heat?
p258_208|He is slightly confused.
p258_209|She should not be blamed.
p258_210|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p258_211|It had all been arranged.
p258_212|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p258_213|His third goal was superb.
p258_214|It's not ideal.
p258_215|We want to keep the pound.
p258_216|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p258_217|He seemed to lose his focus.
p258_218|I might come back.
p258_219|His death was a tragic accident.
p258_220|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p258_221|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p258_222|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p258_223|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p258_224|It's so special.
p258_225|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p258_226|What was the main difference?
p258_227|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p258_228|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p258_229|They are the innocent victims.
p258_230|My wife and family are the support system.
p258_231|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
p258_232|They tried to give her advice.
p258_233|They had no children.
p258_234|We are in the hat.
p258_235|They should come forward.
p258_236|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p258_237|It's quite nice.
p258_238|Hospitals are for the ill.
p258_239|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p258_240|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p258_241|They are all bright and different.
p258_242|It is hard won.
p258_243|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p258_244|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.

p258_377|Well, the big day has arrived.
p258_378|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p258_379|Not because they want to sing about something.
p258_380|Colour was at the core of his life.
p258_381|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p258_382|It was a cry for help.
p258_383|Something is wrong.
p258_384|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
p258_385|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p258_386|That team is due to be announced this morning.
p258_387|That's the name of the game, though.
p258_388|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p258_389|I was so nervous.
p258_390|YOU thought it was a headache.
p258_391|There is a solution, she believes.
p258_392|However, it's good to turn the page.
p258_393|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p258_394|This year I understood.
p259_001|Please call Stella.  )
p259_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
p259_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
p259_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
p259_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )
p259_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
p259_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
p259_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
p259_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
p259_010|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
p259_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
p259_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
p259_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
p259_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
p259_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )
p259_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
p259_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
p259_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
p259_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
p259_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
p259_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
p259_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
p259_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
p259_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
p259_025|But it could prove disastrous.)
p259_026|Smoking is also very important.)
p259_027|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.)
p259_028|I am pretty careful with money.)
p259_029|He has the courage of the unaware.)
p259_030|I could not do it.)

p259_043|Several investments have already been made.)
p259_044|The boy is no longer with us.)

p259_049|I had come back from London.)
p259_050|Pulled a huge number of viewers.)
p259_051|I had trouble with the producers.)
p259_052|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.)

p259_054|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.)
p259_055|The problems are a result of that shortfall.)

p259_069|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.)
p259_070|Even the one she loved.)
p259_071|Today it was really enjoyable.)
p259_072|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.)
p259_073|It was a unanimous decision.)

p259_087|So is that it, then ?)
p259_088|Do I have a favourite ?)

p259_101|I did not have a bet on myself.)
p259_102|The selection process is still at a very early stage.)
p259_103|It's good to have a voice.)
p259_104|They will remember this victory for a while.)
p259_105|But they must believe in themselves.)
p259_106|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.)
p259_107|The following are the principal provisions.)

p259_119|We have the mental strength.)
p259_120|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.)
p259_121|That admission is not surprising.)
p259_122|In addition, investor choice is reduced.)
p259_123|We had another last Tuesday.)
p259_124|It is too pretty, it is too small.)
p259_125|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.)
p259_126|We did what we had to do.)
p259_127|But it is different in different regions.)

p259_143|Are you going to win ?)
p259_144|Was it the wife ?)
p259_145|Why change it ?)

p259_148|how do you get it back ?)
p259_149|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.)
p259_150|The referee faces a massive job.)
p259_151|His second goal was equally impressive.)
p259_152|He was seen as the enemy.)
p259_153|That group reported just before Christmas.)
p259_154|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.)
p259_155|It opens the door to the Champions League.)
p259_156|So I got a blood test.)

p259_158|I haven't made any definite decisions.)

p259_165|Behind him was his brother.)
p259_166|It was by the numbers.)
p259_167|The woman was his wife.)
p259_168|This action reflects a slump in bookings.)
p259_169|He was right into football from an early age.)
p259_170|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.)
p259_171|It's never great to finish second.)

p259_173|We have a budget in March.)
p259_174|Adventure is the champagne of life.)
p259_175|US is the only country to vote against resolution.)
p259_176|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.)
p259_177|The people are the hero.)
p259_178|I always felt they played for me.)
p259_179|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.)
p259_180|The second aspect was the fear of failure.)
p259_181|Phase one was a shambles.)
p259_182|If that's the case, he will struggle.)
p259_183|It is vital to clarify their role.)
p259_184|I'm just going to hit the shot.)
p259_185|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.)
p259_186|Each case is treated on merit.)
p259_187|It is only the beginning.)

p259_202|It had little effect on European equity markets.)
p259_203|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.)
p259_204|It's very difficult to find a buyer.)
p259_205|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.)
p259_206|In due course we will make an announcement.)
p259_207|He should emerge as the winner.)
p259_208|He was then replaced by Ross.)
p259_209|And they were being paid ?)
p259_210|was everything done to save people ?)
p259_211|What was the matter for concern ?)
p259_212|Do I think about them often ?)
p259_213|Is it in the right place ?)

p259_219|The early physical reports were clear.)
p259_220|The result is utterly compelling.)
p259_221|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.)
p259_222|This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.)
p259_223|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.)
p259_224|Little is known about them.)
p259_225|I won't make an official complaint.)
p259_226|It was worth a photograph.)
p259_227|The move follows a review of the Singapore)
p259_228|We have an election in eight days.)
p259_229|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.)
p259_230|January is a bad time of year.)

p259_236|My daughter is an adult.)
p259_237|His third goal was superb.)
p259_238|It was finally agreed on Saturday.)
p259_239|They are difficult awards to decide.)
p259_240|I am considered a teenager.)
p259_241|Anyway, the job will be part-time.)
p259_242|He must get to know himself.)
p259_243|The transaction is not feasible.)
p259_244|People should make their own decisions.)
p259_245|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.)
p259_246|Things were so intense in the studio.)
p259_247|We will reform the welfare state.)
p259_248|His background is firmly in venture capital.)
p259_249|It's easy to be negative about these things.)
p259_250|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.)
p259_251|The scientific debate is dead.)
p259_252|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.)
p259_253|You are like an animal.)
p259_254|The body follows the mind.)
p259_255|We will try to find someone.)

p259_265|Did it work ?)
p259_266|Do you think we are a top nation ?)
p259_267|Is our children learning ?)

p259_285|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.)
p259_286|You have got the evidence.)
p259_287|We accept the new rules.)
p259_288|It is probably in the culture.)
p259_289|On the contrary they stand to gain.)
p259_290|Blair is very positive at European Councils.)
p259_291|He took over our lives.)
p259_292|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.)
p259_293|I'd never run for them.)
p259_294|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.)
p259_295|They must play for each other.)
p259_296|These figures are truly terrible.)
p259_297|I felt about this big.)
p259_298|It is also very valuable.)
p259_299|There's not much money in cycling.)
p259_300|The stage was set for a showdown.)
p259_301|This could put pressure on UK inflation.)

p259_309|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.)
p259_310|I understand the security issue.)
p259_311|Frankly, we should all have such problems.)
p259_312|It seemed a logical expansion.)
p259_313|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.)
p259_314|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.)
p259_315|It's hard to see it.)
p259_316|The record companies have gone through the floor.)

p259_327|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.)

p259_330|No Briton has ever won.)
p259_331|Are they free ?)
p259_332|What are they for ?)
p259_333|Is there a waiting list ?)
p259_334|Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
p259_335|So what happens next ?)
p259_336|Had this been common practice ?)
p259_337|What do they want us to do ?)
p259_338|Is it worth it ?)
p259_339|His appeal is instantly understood.)
p259_340|The results are sometimes contentious.)
p259_341|The songs are just so good.)
p259_342|This will save interest charges.)
p259_343|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.)
p259_344|Sunday's game was not a trial.)

p259_358|I didn't have the reply.)
p259_359|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.)
p259_360|You may have a short memory.)
p259_361|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.)
p259_362|A Home Office spokesman said.)
p259_363|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.)
p259_364|It's too horrible to think.)
p259_365|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.)
p259_366|Industrial action has to hurt.)
p259_367|Nobody said it was required.)
p259_368|It was tough to contain the excitement.)
p259_369|They promised to fight the plans.)
p259_370|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.)
p259_371|He was unable to come.)
p259_372|He was at school in Devon.)
p259_373|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.)
p259_374|Finally came the moment of truth.)
p259_375|Whether this return was too soon.)
p259_376|Neither man has been charged.)
p259_377|An alternative must be offered.)
p259_378|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.)
p259_379|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.)
p259_380|He can handle it without any problem.)

p259_382|He is an excellent manager.)
p259_383|I think we'll just keep it.)
p259_384|The Allies intend to maintain the average.)
p259_385|I've always been a sensitive.)
p259_386|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.)
p259_387|He had no previous convictions.)
p259_388|It was a massive error of judgment.)
p259_389|They should take their mobile phones.)
p259_390|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.)
p259_391|They have broken that promise.)
p259_392|Does it matter ?)
p259_393|How do you take them away ?)
p259_394|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
p259_395|After the match, do you ?)
p259_396|That is a crazy situation.)
p259_397|We are really good friends.)
p259_398|The principle is quite clear.)
p259_399|The salary changes are long overdue.)
p259_400|The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.)
p259_401|She said they would appeal.)
p259_402|They were to blame for the first two goals.)
p259_403|It would be quite nice.)
p259_404|This remains the party's policy.)
p259_405|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.)
p259_406|The parties include the Scottish Executive.)
p259_407|We will win the argument.)
p259_408|Everything is now in place for Manchester.)
p259_409|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.)
p259_410|The team hadn't been picked.)
p259_411|The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack.)
p259_412|It sounds like a wish list.)
p259_413|The director will be present.)
p259_414|It is the nature of his party.)
p259_415|Theatre is not a museum.)
p259_416|We have very limited capacity.)
p259_417|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.)
p259_418|My view has now completely changed.)
p259_419|I had a fortunate war.)
p259_420|It's too close to call.)
p259_421|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.)
p259_422|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.)
p259_423|I've had a wonderful career.)
p259_424|The BBC was a disgrace.)
p259_425|It is hard to understand.)
p259_426|But the foundations have been laid.)
p259_427|There was an element of frustration.)
p259_428|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.)
p259_429|The casualties were not named.)
p259_430|The next few months will tell.)
p259_431|It is not over by any means.)
p259_432|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.)
p259_433|Three years ago he would have been.)
p259_434|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.)
p259_435|I watch the other visitors.)
p259_436|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.)
p259_437|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.)
p259_438|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.)
p259_439|There is a solution, she believes.)
p259_440|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.)
p259_441|It was submitted without their knowledge.)
p259_442|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.)
p259_443|My aim is a top six finish.)
p259_444|It means an enormous amount.)
p259_445|Such an attack is bizarre.)
p259_446|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.)
p259_447|I never had a childhood.)
p259_448|No-one wanted to run it tonight.)
p259_449|None of the pieces was commissioned.)
p259_450|There is another important factor.)
p259_451|I never found my rhythm.)
p259_452|In fact, the reasons are simple.)
p259_453|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.)
p259_454|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.)
p259_455|Nobody has told the story.)
p259_456|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)
p259_457|He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.)
p259_458|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.)
p259_459|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.)
p259_460|It is pretty bad news.)
p259_461|It certainly appeared that way.)
p260_001|Please call Stella.
p260_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p260_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p260_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p260_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p260_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p260_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p260_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p260_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p260_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p260_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p260_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p260_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p260_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p260_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p260_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p260_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p260_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p260_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p260_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p260_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p260_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p260_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p260_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p260_025|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p260_026|We will be homeless.
p260_027|Is this accurate?
p260_028|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p260_029|They have no history.
p260_030|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p260_031|I'd just like to play.
p260_032|There's a story, too.
p260_033|This is the window.
p260_034|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p260_035|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p260_036|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p260_037|It's a fact.
p260_038|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p260_039|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p260_040|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p260_041|Dancing was her life.
p260_042|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p260_043|We will push.
p260_044|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p260_045|Among them are many criminals.
p260_046|It is marvellous.
p260_047|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p260_048|Our people are ready.
p260_049|Here's a clue.
p260_050|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p260_051|I was inspired by two things.
p260_052|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p260_053|My fitness was very poor.
p260_054|Sadly, it can't.
p260_055|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p260_056|I expect a rapid response.
p260_057|What was the main difference?
p260_058|There's a danger.
p260_059|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p260_060|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p260_061|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p260_062|It's that kind of place.
p260_063|They are real.
p260_064|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p260_065|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p260_066|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p260_067|That was a gold medal for certain.
p260_068|We should have known.
p260_069|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p260_070|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p260_071|He was at home with his pals.
p260_072|It was magic.
p260_073|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p260_074|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p260_075|Is there a new way forward?
p260_076|The party is up for it.
p260_077|Even the one she loved.
p260_078|People must remain vigilant.
p260_079|Today she has been released.
p260_080|Who will pay for this?
p260_081|He had taken everything from me.
p260_082|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p260_083|By then, he was walking on water.
p260_084|They lived for their children.
p260_085|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p260_086|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p260_087|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p260_088|It is a lifeline.
p260_089|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p260_090|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p260_091|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p260_092|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p260_093|Then came the crunch.
p260_094|It is annoying.
p260_095|I love the Dome.
p260_096|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p260_097|I am extremely sad.
p260_098|It is a love affair.
p260_099|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p260_100|May not have been at fault?
p260_101|They tried to deny it.
p260_102|They make a selective perception process.
p260_103|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p260_104|That's all right then.
p260_105|Oil embargo endorsed.
p260_106|Before the game we went for a pint.
p260_107|She reflects a bit.
p260_108|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p260_109|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p260_110|It was a funny game.
p260_111|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p260_112|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p260_113|It was the eighties.
p260_114|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p260_115|It is so sad.
p260_116|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p260_117|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p260_118|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p260_119|It is rubbish.
p260_120|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p260_121|We enjoyed it today.
p260_122|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p260_123|There were no grounds for his action.
p260_124|I can't even get into the A team.
p260_125|She really suffered for her art.
p260_126|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p260_127|The people will come.
p260_128|No production was achieved.
p260_129|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p260_130|It plans to return to this field.
p260_131|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p260_132|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p260_133|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p260_134|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p260_135|I don't know the full story.
p260_136|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p260_137|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p260_138|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p260_139|I was awful.
p260_140|The idea is simple.
p260_141|That group reported just before Christmas.
p260_142|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p260_143|It is not just about pay.
p260_144|Note the date.
p260_145|So I got a blood test.
p260_146|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p260_147|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p260_148|The weather forecast isn't good.
p260_149|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p260_150|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p260_151|I was on a roll.
p260_152|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p260_153|We are on a four-year mission.
p260_154|My Dad is a hero.
p260_155|He was asked to quit.
p260_156|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p260_157|He can do no wrong.
p260_158|Was this element always there?
p260_159|These days are long gone.
p260_160|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p260_161|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p260_162|They are not advertised.
p260_163|Seven people were later detained by police.
p260_164|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p260_165|Again, we were lucky.
p260_166|They will do their own thing.
p260_167|Does that put pressure on us?
p260_168|One season, they might do well.
p260_169|Is Saddam a threat?
p260_170|As we worked.
p260_171|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p260_172|It is not either national standards or local control.
p260_173|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p260_174|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p260_175|Everyone can be bought.
p260_176|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p260_177|I've been there.
p260_178|Four policemen were wounded.
p260_179|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p260_180|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p260_181|What has caused the demise of singing?
p260_182|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p260_183|Our team is just so young.
p260_184|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p260_185|It is a farce.
p260_186|Peace was won.
p260_187|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p260_188|I came home by ambulance.
p260_189|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p260_190|Is that success?
p260_191|They are ready.
p260_192|I have a cold.
p260_193|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p260_194|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p260_195|It's all about money, money, money.
p260_196|There was no safety net.
p260_197|It was worth a photograph.
p260_198|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p260_199|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p260_200|There was an e-mail.
p260_201|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p260_202|I am delighted for Simon.
p260_203|It had all been arranged.
p260_204|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p260_205|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p260_206|It's not ideal.
p260_207|In each case they were a goal down.
p260_208|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p260_209|I might come back.
p260_210|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p260_211|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p260_212|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p260_213|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p260_214|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p260_215|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p260_216|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p260_217|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p260_218|It's not before time.
p260_219|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p260_220|The report is due out next month.
p260_221|But she was.
p260_222|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p260_223|My wife and family are the support system.
p260_224|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
p260_225|We were awful.
p260_226|They tried to give her advice.
p260_227|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p260_228|The parties have been given until today to respond.
p260_229|There is no excuse.
p260_230|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p260_231|But it's a subtle process.
p260_232|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p260_233|The car was just there.
p260_234|The whole thing will be great.
p260_235|Our policy is clear.
p260_236|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p260_237|You can feel at home in China.
p260_238|The scene is about this?
p260_239|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p260_240|It was a kind of contempt.
p260_241|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p260_242|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p260_243|I should think so, too.
p260_244|It was a hit.
p260_245|There's the mix.
p260_246|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p260_247|Is there on his hands?
p260_248|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p260_249|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p260_250|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p260_251|Chelsea was a great club.
p260_252|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p260_253|We have to expand.
p260_254|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p260_255|Is that a serious question?
p260_256|They must play for each other.
p260_257|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p260_258|There's not much money in cycling.
p260_259|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p260_260|I am just trying to do my job.
p260_261|This is a question of Islam.
p260_262|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p260_263|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p260_264|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p260_265|The system can work.
p260_266|We're in shock.
p260_267|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p260_268|It's a way of life.
p260_269|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p260_270|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p260_271|They seem to get away with it.
p260_272|She looked so young.
p260_273|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p260_274|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p260_275|If not, he should go home.
p260_276|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p260_277|We are a grandmother.
p260_278|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p260_279|You feel very helpless.
p260_280|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p260_281|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p260_282|He will address the nation this evening.
p260_283|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p260_284|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p260_285|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p260_286|This is a national crisis.
p260_287|Bombing slaughter rejected
p260_288|We are not going to forget.
p260_289|No Briton has ever won.
p260_290|Painful, but only because it's true.
p260_291|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p260_292|The songs are just so good.
p260_293|And it's a goodbye from him.
p260_294|The goals will come.
p260_295|Who can predict?
p260_296|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p260_297|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p260_298|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p260_299|I was the sheep.
p260_300|What has altered?
p260_301|Nothing is safe.
p260_302|One was a lawyer.
p260_303|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p260_304|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p260_305|They are wrong.
p260_306|I can live with it.
p260_307|Work has started.
p260_308|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p260_309|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p260_310|You should be.
p260_311|The minister is the engineer.
p260_312|The letters are going out today.
p260_313|We want to play at the worlds.
p260_314|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p260_315|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p260_316|Special measures were needed.
p260_317|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p260_318|The show is at an end.
p260_319|Your father was a good man.
p260_320|Such actions are rarely popular.
p260_321|We have got to get the points from this one.
p260_322|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p260_323|Henman has been warned.
p260_324|I would love it.
p260_326|The problems began a long time ago.
p260_327|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p260_328|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p260_329|We are in the end game.
p260_330|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p260_331|There was no time scale.
p260_332|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p260_333|It is a job creation scheme.
p260_334|Relief was beyond belief.
p260_335|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p260_336|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p260_337|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p261_001|Please call Stella.
p261_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p261_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p261_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p261_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p261_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p261_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p261_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p261_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p261_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p261_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p261_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p261_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p261_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p261_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p261_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p261_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p261_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p261_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p261_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p261_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p261_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p261_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p261_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p261_025|They are very clever in their use of words.
p261_026|Meetings will also remain private.
p261_027|Because we do not need it.
p261_028|Life was like a timetable.
p261_029|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p261_030|We will look into it.
p261_031|I have never been a member of the council.
p261_032|It was a close call.
p261_033|That means an extra two years.
p261_034|This film will be totally awesome.
p261_035|That was the case with David.
p261_036|He is believed to live in Britain.
p261_037|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p261_038|This represents a tough game for us.
p261_039|Their campaign is in disarray.
p261_040|Among them are many criminals.
p261_041|I was released after six days.
p261_042|That's been the difference between the sides.
p261_043|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p261_044|I would love to have him home.
p261_045|He will need that machine.
p261_046|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
p261_047|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p261_048|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p261_049|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p261_050|There was no safety net.
p261_051|I must take a seat.
p261_052|It is on the news.
p261_053|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p261_054|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p261_055|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p261_056|We will pay their bills.
p261_057|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p261_058|How are you, sir ?
p261_059|So is that it, then ?
p261_060|Do I have a favourite ?
p261_061|What do we do ?
p261_062|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p261_063|Only water is currently allowed.
p261_064|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p261_065|It's not covered by the insurance.
p261_066|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p261_067|That's not the intention at all.
p261_068|It starts with the script.
p261_069|There could be a way back.
p261_070|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p261_071|Then followed a bout of flu.
p261_072|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p261_073|The price cuts are really exciting.
p261_074|He is now resident in England.
p261_075|These people are not big names.
p261_076|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p261_077|He is in the queue.
p261_078|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p261_079|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p261_080|We have to offer value for money.
p261_081|Our mother is very worried.
p261_082|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p261_083|They lived for their children.
p261_084|Potions said he would drive.
p261_085|They deserve a lot of credit.
p261_086|However, it did not end that way.
p261_087|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p261_088|It is high time to act.
p261_089|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p261_090|However, on this showing it's going to be a difficult task.
p261_091|We could not get any possession.
p261_092|It was clear on Thursday.
p261_093|But it is up again.
p261_094|All the pressure will be on him.
p261_095|You are like an animal.
p261_096|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p261_097|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p261_098|I had a ball today.
p261_099|No, the equipment is extra.
p261_100|It is a good lifestyle.
p261_101|Before the game we went for a pint.
p261_102|We are also looking for new licences.
p261_103|Our house was very small.
p261_104|It was a funny game.
p261_105|Why do it otherwise ?
p261_106|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p261_107|So, did she meet him ?
p261_108|So what is the campaign about ?
p261_109|And does it ?
p261_110|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p261_111|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
p261_112|It became a national network.
p261_113|He thought she was amazing.
p261_114|Maybe this battle has been.
p261_115|It isn't a happy memory.
p261_116|Actors like to be in the centre.
p261_117|It's not a quick fix.
p261_118|But it took a lot of bottle.
p261_119|Structural changes were also required.
p261_120|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
p261_121|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p261_122|I was on a roll.
p261_123|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
p261_124|My life has changed a lot.
p261_125|If not, a deal could take many months.
p261_126|That would open the gates of hell.
p261_127|He can perform well under pressure.
p261_128|I have accepted the challenge.
p261_129|You are a gambling man.
p261_130|He is a great addition to our team.
p261_131|This is a successful outcome.
p261_132|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p261_133|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p261_134|We will try to find someone.
p261_135|The others have all been in storage for some time.
p261_136|She died at her home.
p261_137|We could easily have lost that game.
p261_138|Check that he is dead.
p261_139|Several messages can be taken from the occasion.
p261_140|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p261_141|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p261_142|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p261_143|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p261_144|I would relish the prospect.
p261_145|It has become a way of life.
p261_146|Like the others, he was arrested.
p261_147|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p261_148|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p261_149|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p261_150|It was by the numbers.
p261_151|But I am still awaiting an answer.
p261_152|We will turn the corner.
p261_153|He was asked to quit.
p261_154|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p261_155|The strong pound also took its toll.
p261_156|These days are long gone.
p261_157|The bank was now involved.
p261_158|We have to move forward.
p261_159|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p261_160|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p261_161|The pension levels will remain the same.
p261_162|I would probably have to agree with him.
p261_163|You had to go and see him.
p261_164|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p261_165|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p261_166|The region is open for business.
p261_167|They could not match it.
p261_168|What happened in that game ?
p261_169|Are you going to win ?
p261_170|Was it the wife ?
p261_171|Why change it ?
p261_172|What do we want to do that for ?
p261_173|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p261_174|I always felt they played for me.
p261_175|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p261_176|It is a body blow.
p261_177|The jury is still out.
p261_178|It is not either national standards or local control.
p261_179|City sentiment is in his favour.
p261_180|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p261_181|These men could be anywhere in the world.
p261_182|I will be in Scotland.
p261_183|Says the Duke of York.
p261_184|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p261_185|I had too much to drink.
p261_186|They need to look after themselves.
p261_187|He prefers to play for them.
p261_188|That is a waste of energy.
p261_189|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p261_190|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
p261_191|That was the theory, anyway.
p261_192|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p261_193|It had been in place since last July.
p261_194|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
p261_195|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p261_196|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p261_197|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p261_198|He should emerge as the winner.
p261_199|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p261_200|I made a terrible start.
p261_201|It was a moment of madness.
p261_202|We believe a third party was involved.
p261_203|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p261_204|It was his own decision.
p261_205|Does the name matter ?
p261_206|how do you get it back ?
p261_207|What are you not good at ?
p261_208|I think, therefore I am ?
p261_209|Who was she ?
p261_210|A deadline is still essential.
p261_211|I chose to go by the rules.
p261_212|I won't make an official complaint.
p261_213|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p261_214|They are looking at a flotation.
p261_215|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p261_216|We have an election in eight days.
p261_217|It was far from business as usual.
p261_218|All will be revealed in due course.
p261_219|They have known the hard times.
p261_220|It has been like that all year for me.
p261_221|Construction is due to begin in February.
p261_222|Seven people were critically injured.
p261_223|My daughter is an adult.
p261_224|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p261_225|He must get to know himself.
p261_226|It was a day for records.
p261_227|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p261_228|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p261_229|Life is too short to be bitter.
p261_230|A terrorist is a terrorist.
p261_231|It could be to do with the location.
p261_232|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p261_233|The statement contained no surprises.
p261_234|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p261_235|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p261_236|They have not been in touch with the club.
p261_237|I need a publishing deal!
p261_238|They tried to give her advice.
p261_239|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p261_240|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p261_241|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p261_242|This is a family club.
p261_243|It is the loss of my name.
p261_244|I haven't made the donation yet.
p261_245|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p261_246|The irony was not lost.
p261_247|We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
p261_248|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p261_249|I was just a kid.
p261_250|It is now the big brother.
p261_251|They showed a lot of heart.
p261_252|Nato was not a love affair.
p261_253|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
p261_254|It was a poor performance.
p261_255|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p261_256|We want to play at the worlds.
p261_257|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p261_258|We will listen to any suggestion.
p261_259|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p261_260|I should think so, too.
p261_261|No production contract is yet in sight.
p261_262|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p261_263|It seems a shame to leave it.
p261_264|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p261_265|This idea has been around for four years.
p261_266|The concerns are the same.
p261_267|I can't get a job.
p261_268|And they were being paid ?
p261_269|was everything done to save people ?
p261_270|What was the matter for concern ?
p261_271|Do I think about them often ?
p261_272|Is it in the right place ?
p261_273|Did he trip ?
p261_274|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p261_275|I was ready for this.
p261_276|They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
p261_277|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p261_278|They are interior designers and architects.
p261_279|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p261_280|The Scotch whisky industry is absent from the agenda.
p261_281|The offer will run for the next three weekends.
p261_282|At first I thought I was gone.
p261_283|I am just trying to do my job.
p261_284|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p261_285|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p261_286|They can leave at any time.
p261_287|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p261_288|It would be a tragedy if it had to close.
p261_289|He has not created a Festival resource.
p261_290|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p261_291|He has run a hell of a race.
p261_292|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p261_293|He was also married with two children.
p261_294|It was an easy decision to come here.
p261_295|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
p261_296|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p261_297|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p261_298|A senior party insider said.
p261_299|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p261_300|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p261_301|This will help our confidence.
p261_302|The two companies were not for sale.
p261_303|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
p261_304|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p261_305|The cause of the accident remained unclear.
p261_306|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p261_307|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p261_308|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p261_309|We will deliver at director level.
p261_310|Size is not the issue.
p261_311|He will address the nation this evening.
p261_312|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p261_313|Tony Blair said as little.
p261_314|His was a huge success story.
p261_315|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p261_316|That is the general feeling.
p261_317|Holland won by five wickets.
p261_318|He was obviously very genuine.
p261_319|The casting is as perfect.
p261_320|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p261_321|A Home Office spokesman said.
p261_322|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p261_323|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p261_324|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p261_325|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p261_326|It is a potential danger.
p261_327|Cast Away now on general release.
p261_328|That could bring the peace process to a standstill.
p261_329|The City welcomed the numbers.
p261_330|You will never get a conviction.
p261_331|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p261_332|That meant the search was unlawful.
p261_333|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p261_334|There will be good prospects ahead.
p261_335|I would do away with the dress code.
p261_336|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p261_337|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p261_338|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p261_339|What form did that take ?
p261_340|Are they free ?
p261_341|What are they for ?
p261_342|Is there a waiting list ?
p261_343|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p261_344|So what happens next ?
p261_345|This ruling is a farce.
p261_346|Both men were on one-year contracts.
p261_347|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p261_348|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p261_349|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p261_350|Thousands of British tourists were trapped in their hotels.
p261_351|The whole family was in shock.
p261_352|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p261_353|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p261_354|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p261_355|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p261_356|I've got a sense of humour, too.
p261_357|Her life is now back on track.
p261_358|There was some merit in that.
p261_359|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p261_360|It's too horrible to think.
p261_361|They are now out in the cold.
p261_362|At first, the youngster was not keen.
p261_363|My view has now completely changed.
p261_364|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p261_365|He was then replaced by Ross.
p261_366|He is not very big, either.
p261_367|Finally came the moment of truth.
p261_368|Neither man has been charged.
p261_369|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p261_370|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p261_371|He did a good job.
p261_372|Had this been common practice ?
p261_373|What do they want us to do ?
p261_374|Is it worth it ?
p261_375|Does it matter ?
p261_376|He took a draw on his cigarette.
p261_377|I am a lucky man.
p261_378|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p261_379|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p261_380|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p261_381|You did not see it.
p261_382|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p261_383|They should take their mobile phones.
p261_384|We regret that they were brought in the first place.
p261_385|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p261_386|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p261_387|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p261_388|He must have seen the movie.
p261_389|We must put a marker down.
p261_390|The result is called a patent.
p261_391|It's as wide as a church in here.
p261_392|This remains the party's policy.
p261_393|The pair are very much in love.
p261_394|I am a good player.
p261_395|You have to rely on each other.
p261_396|However, it was well worth the wait.
p261_397|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p261_398|I wanted to go out on a high.
p261_399|I felt the head was very like me.
p261_400|It was fit for royalty.
p261_401|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p261_402|We operate as a Scottish company.
p261_403|How do you take them away ?
p261_404|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p261_405|After the match, do you ?
p261_406|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p261_407|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p261_408|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p261_409|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p261_410|Motion described it as a unique event.
p261_411|I had a fortunate war.
p261_412|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p261_413|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p261_414|It is good for Europe.
p261_415|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p261_416|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p261_417|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p261_418|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p261_419|But a surprise is in store.
p261_420|Smoking is also very important.
p261_421|The second goal was superb.
p261_422|We're delighted about the vote.
p261_423|The case will now go to appeal.
p261_424|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p261_425|Yet the data is compelling.
p261_426|It was important to win the singles.
p261_427|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p261_428|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p261_429|He was on a horse.
p261_430|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p261_431|That's the way it works.
p261_432|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p261_433|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p261_434|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p261_435|He is on the wrong side.
p261_436|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p261_437|It was the climax of the thing.
p261_438|The trial will open today.
p261_439|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
p261_440|It will make a huge difference.
p261_441|It is an absolute nonsense.
p261_442|Everything in golf is a balance.
p261_443|It is a case of pity for us.
p261_444|Gordon is also highly rated.
p261_445|The first game is so important.
p261_446|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p261_447|And we might go back.
p261_448|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p261_449|He deserves a second chance.
p261_450|You have to see the work.
p261_451|The funding is now there.
p261_452|But we have built a platform for next season.
p261_453|I was embarrassed by it.
p261_454|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p262_001|Please call Stella.
p262_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p262_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p262_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p262_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p262_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p262_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p262_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p262_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p262_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p262_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p262_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p262_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p262_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p262_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p262_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p262_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p262_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p262_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p262_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p262_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p262_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p262_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p262_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p262_025|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p262_026|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p262_027|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p262_028|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p262_029|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p262_030|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p262_031|I expected these kind of questions.
p262_032|This is the window.
p262_033|People love to see this stuff.
p262_034|Life was like a timetable.
p262_035|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p262_036|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p262_037|It was clear.
p262_038|The problem is the pitch.
p262_039|It was ugly.
p262_040|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p262_041|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p262_042|The judge said.
p262_043|It's a crucial award.
p262_044|It is difficult for Ali.
p262_045|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p262_046|I was angry.
p262_047|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p262_048|They had to explain it.
p262_049|He had no enemies.
p262_050|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p262_051|Next league matches Celtic.
p262_052|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p262_053|It's very odd.
p262_054|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p262_055|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p262_056|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p262_057|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
p262_058|Jobs could go.
p262_059|And a film maker was born.
p262_060|I fell against him.
p262_061|There was a battle there.
p262_062|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p262_063|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p262_064|He was popular.
p262_065|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p262_066|It is like a river running by my home.
p262_067|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p262_068|It's all I can do.
p262_069|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p262_070|Then followed a bout of flu.
p262_071|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p262_072|I had my suspicions.
p262_073|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p262_074|I've not thought about it.
p262_075|What has changed?
p262_076|I'd like to continue that record.
p262_077|Detection is often difficult.
p262_078|He is driven.
p262_079|All options are open.
p262_080|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p262_081|Someone who cares
p262_082|It's never too late.
p262_083|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p262_084|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p262_085|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p262_086|Today I couldn't run on it.
p262_087|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
p262_088|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p262_089|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p262_090|Then came the crunch.
p262_091|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p262_092|They are now divorced.
p262_093|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p262_094|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p262_095|FOR once, you should believe the hype.
p262_096|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p262_097|It is a good day for the coalition.
p262_098|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p262_099|Two of the team became ill.
p262_100|Oil embargo endorsed.
p262_101|It is a good lifestyle.
p262_102|It was an adventure.
p262_103|It's not perfect.
p262_104|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p262_105|He pleaded for caution.
p262_106|They are ready.
p262_107|It's a shame.
p262_108|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p262_109|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p262_110|They were behind the wheel.
p262_111|This film will be totally awesome.
p262_112|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p262_113|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p262_114|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p262_115|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p262_116|Who would have?
p262_117|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p262_118|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p262_119|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p262_120|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p262_121|So the European elections are extremely important.
p262_122|It was the same at Twickenham.
p262_123|It plans to return to this field.
p262_124|Our intentions are real.
p262_125|The goals were good.
p262_126|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p262_127|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p262_128|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p262_129|It's a question of fashion.
p262_130|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p262_131|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p262_132|We need to chat.
p262_133|She died at her home.
p262_134|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
p262_135|It would be a last resort.
p262_136|That group reported just before Christmas.
p262_137|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p262_138|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p262_139|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p262_140|It is huge.
p262_141|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
p262_142|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p262_143|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p262_144|Mr Blair had done well.
p262_145|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p262_146|We should be clear about the role of government.
p262_147|It is a freedom.
p262_148|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p262_149|I knew he was good.
p262_150|They were later discharged from hospital.
p262_151|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p262_152|Neither side can win this war.
p262_153|He can do no wrong.
p262_154|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p262_155|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
p262_156|He's been the key to everything.
p262_157|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p262_158|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p262_159|As, indeed, they would be.
p262_160|They are not advertised.
p262_161|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p262_162|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p262_163|It's that sort of night.
p262_164|It is not too late to get on board.
p262_165|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p262_166|We have a budget in March.
p262_167|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p262_168|The post will be unpaid.
p262_169|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p262_170|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p262_171|We've made a couple of albums.
p262_172|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p262_173|Is Saddam a threat?
p262_174|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p262_175|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p262_176|The clarity is vital.
p262_177|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p262_178|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p262_179|That has been the easy part.
p262_180|He will need that machine.
p262_181|Nothing is safe.
p262_182|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p262_183|They need to look after themselves.
p262_184|Miller was every bit as happy.
p262_185|I had a train to catch.
p262_186|That would be my view.
p262_187|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p262_188|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p262_189|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p262_190|It wasn't to be.
p262_191|I came home by ambulance.
p262_192|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p262_193|Our strategy is straightforward.
p262_194|The group is separate from the Real IRA.
p262_195|People acted too quickly.
p262_196|The service from the other players was super.
p262_197|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
p262_198|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p262_199|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p262_200|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p262_201|They are in the euro.
p262_202|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p262_203|It's all about money, money, money.
p262_204|There was no rescue.
p262_205|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p262_206|But I am a worried man.
p262_207|There was an e-mail.
p262_208|It's a big deal for me.
p262_209|We'll have to work hard today.
p262_210|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p262_211|I had decided to quit the show.
p262_212|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p262_213|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p262_214|He seemed to lose his focus.
p262_215|Work has started.
p262_216|His death was a tragic accident.
p262_217|But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
p262_218|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p262_219|We have not given up hope.
p262_220|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p262_221|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p262_222|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p262_223|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p262_224|The track is currently covered in snow.
p262_225|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p262_226|At the time, he was a living legend.
p262_227|The Dow Jones is way up.
p262_228|However, no further action was taken by police.
p262_229|It's that kind of place.
p262_230|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
p262_231|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p262_232|It's very safe.
p262_233|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p262_234|It is a terrible loss.
p262_235|But it's a subtle process.
p262_236|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p262_237|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p262_238|He was good, but not that good.
p262_239|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p262_240|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p262_241|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p262_242|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p262_243|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p262_244|They may yet have the last laugh.
p262_245|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p262_246|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p262_247|The scene is about this?
p262_248|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p262_249|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p262_250|I was shocked.
p262_251|A friendship that will endure.
p262_252|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
p262_253|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p262_254|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p262_255|That could be in place by next year.
p262_256|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p262_257|We run within the law.
p262_258|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p262_259|This is a big club.
p262_260|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p262_261|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p262_262|I am very angry.
p262_263|I saw one body.
p262_264|At first I thought I was gone.
p262_265|They wanted the club to make money.
p262_266|We shall rely on human beings.
p262_267|Immediate action must be taken.
p262_268|It's very nice.
p262_269|He was also married with two children.
p262_270|It was an easy decision to come here.
p262_271|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p262_272|It's not even finished.
p262_273|Things can change.
p262_274|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p262_275|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p262_276|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p262_277|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p262_278|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p262_279|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p262_280|We have to break that cycle.
p262_281|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p262_282|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p262_283|I saw it at a ruck.
p262_284|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p262_285|He will address the nation this evening.
p262_286|The attacker died in the crash.
p262_287|It was a virus.
p262_288|The mood is good.
p262_289|This is a national crisis.
p262_290|The death toll included five children.
p262_291|Who did the recruiting?
p262_292|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p262_293|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p262_294|Well, he can do it.
p262_295|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p262_296|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p262_297|And huge, indeed, it is.
p262_298|The results are sometimes contentious.
p262_299|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p262_300|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p262_301|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p262_302|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p262_303|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p262_304|What has altered?
p262_305|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p262_306|One was a lawyer.
p262_307|However, the groups denied the claims.
p262_308|They should be swept away.
p262_309|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p262_310|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p262_311|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p262_312|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p262_313|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p262_314|The letters are going out today.
p262_315|We want to play at the worlds.
p262_316|Is there on his hands?
p262_317|Special measures were needed.
p262_318|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p262_319|I never thought it would take this long.
p262_320|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p262_321|We are a peaceful people.
p262_322|It should be equal.
p262_323|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p262_324|The problems began a long time ago.
p262_325|My body is clearly capable.
p262_326|He said she was mad.
p262_327|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p262_328|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p262_329|We are in the end game.
p262_330|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p262_331|The parents will have a great time, too.
p262_332|I am so upset.
p262_333|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p262_334|It could have gone either way.
p262_335|He was then replaced by Ross.
p262_336|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p262_337|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p262_338|The team for the first game could be this one.
p262_339|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p262_340|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
p262_341|His views are hardly surprising.
p262_342|I would miss him.
p262_343|It will be very, very tight.
p262_344|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p262_345|It was forced to divert.
p262_346|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p262_347|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p262_348|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p262_349|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p262_350|I got a yellow card.
p262_351|There is no link.
p262_352|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p262_353|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p262_354|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p262_355|A man has since been charged with his murder.
p262_356|It is horrible.
p262_357|The council said the house would have to be demolished.
p262_358|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p262_359|He's very explosive.
p262_360|It was one in the afternoon.
p262_361|We will be homeless.
p262_362|That would help.
p262_363|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p262_364|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p262_365|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p262_366|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p262_367|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p262_368|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p262_369|Talks are progressing.
p262_370|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p262_371|It was a funny game.
p262_372|It is a large number.
p262_373|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p262_374|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p263_001|Please call Stella.
p263_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p263_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p263_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p263_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p263_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p263_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p263_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p263_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p263_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p263_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p263_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p263_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p263_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p263_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p263_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p263_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p263_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p263_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p263_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p263_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p263_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p263_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p263_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p263_025|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p263_026|How are you, sir ?
p263_027|So is that it, then ?
p263_028|Do I have a favourite ?
p263_029|What do we do ?
p263_030|We would like to find another region to develop in England.
p263_031|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p263_032|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p263_033|Allan Johnston was not match fit.
p263_034|The idea is not new.
p263_035|I could not do it.
p263_036|Life was like a timetable.
p263_037|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p263_038|You have to expect this type of thing.
p263_039|No company would want to put their people at risk.
p263_040|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p263_041|It could well be the case.
p263_042|This work on a marketing strategy would be finished within two months.
p263_043|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p263_044|It will come all right.
p263_045|It seemed the tough times were behind him.
p263_046|That company should not be allowed to operate in this country.
p263_047|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
p263_048|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p263_049|I didn't think any player was a success on Saturday.
p263_050|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
p263_051|I would love to have him home.
p263_052|He looks like an Afghan.
p263_053|He will need that machine.
p263_054|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
p263_055|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p263_056|We have not given up hope.
p263_057|It will now take over the running of the estate.
p263_058|I've got to provide for my family.
p263_059|It was bound to happen.
p263_060|Four other charges were dropped.
p263_061|We have to keep our clients.
p263_062|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p263_063|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p263_064|I am pleased to be in them.
p263_065|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p263_066|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
p263_067|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p263_068|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p263_069|It is the only way forward for the club.
p263_070|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p263_071|It's all I can do.
p263_072|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p263_073|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p263_074|It is a job creation scheme.
p263_075|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p263_076|Even the one she loved.
p263_077|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p263_078|So, did she meet him ?
p263_079|So what is the campaign about ?
p263_080|And does it ?
p263_081|Are you from the rugby ?
p263_082|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p263_083|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p263_084|The insurance company is only interested in your profits.
p263_085|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p263_086|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
p263_087|The damage from the fire was huge.
p263_088|A play is a set of actions.
p263_089|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p263_090|Scottish rugby has been in a state of civil war.
p263_091|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
p263_092|The first few days will determine whether she can survive.
p263_093|The trick is to try it.
p263_094|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p263_095|It might change your life.
p263_096|No-one in the passenger train was hurt.
p263_097|Mr Blair should be warned.
p263_098|You might not make it.
p263_099|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p263_100|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p263_101|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p263_102|I did not have a bet on myself.
p263_103|I saw the whole thing.
p263_104|A progress report will be published in October.
p263_105|The investment will be in the food.
p263_106|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p263_107|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p263_108|Our preference is to play in midweek.
p263_109|You are like an animal.
p263_110|In the end we made too many errors.
p263_111|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
p263_112|That all hope is never lost.
p263_113|It should be a great game, though.
p263_114|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p263_115|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p263_116|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p263_117|He was jailed for a year.
p263_118|It was won on the issue of the land.
p263_119|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p263_120|The fire was above the hole.
p263_121|Pupils will be the losers.
p263_122|The problem was a social problem.
p263_123|Such actions are rarely popular.
p263_124|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p263_125|It isn't a happy memory.
p263_126|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
p263_127|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p263_128|They've got to account for it.
p263_129|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
p263_130|It would be great to reward the Scottish public with a win.
p263_131|You can spend money on housing.
p263_132|I told him I was a long time ago.
p263_133|They have to come clean.
p263_134|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p263_135|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p263_136|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p263_137|It is just a tax on employment.
p263_138|The move has provoked a mixed response.
p263_139|The squad is too small.
p263_140|Why change it ?
p263_141|What do we want to do that for ?
p263_142|Does the name matter ?
p263_143|how do you get it back ?
p263_144|The temperature in the town is very difficult to control.
p263_145|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p263_146|Any success would have been an improvement.
p263_147|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
p263_148|I never wanted a legal battle.
p263_149|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p263_150|Next time round, it will be different.
p263_151|She died at her home.
p263_152|We have seen a copy of the report.
p263_153|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
p263_154|It is the quality of the work that counts.
p263_155|Check that he is dead.
p263_156|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p263_157|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p263_158|There is no mandate for a regime change.
p263_159|Like the others, he was arrested.
p263_160|She will do for me.
p263_161|I have had a good life.
p263_162|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p263_163|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p263_164|It is crucial for both teams.
p263_165|However, she did not report the matter to the police.
p263_166|Nobody in Scotland has recognised the creative talent involved in this area.
p263_167|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p263_168|The other businesses were based in Yorkshire and Northern Ireland.
p263_169|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p263_170|Neither side can win this war.
p263_171|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p263_172|These days are long gone.
p263_173|It is an attitude of mind.
p263_174|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p263_175|Eight months later, he was dead.
p263_176|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p263_177|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p263_178|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p263_179|So was the first half.
p263_180|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p263_181|The decision was blamed on weak investment markets.
p263_182|It's nice to be involved.
p263_183|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
p263_184|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p263_185|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p263_186|Time is now very short.
p263_187|Our position remains the same.
p263_188|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p263_189|The region is open for business.
p263_190|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p263_191|The championship is different from the other majors.
p263_192|It makes no influence on the public.
p263_193|I thought he did very well.
p263_194|Says the Duke of York.
p263_195|The shooting created panic in the street.
p263_196|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p263_197|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p263_198|You know the sort of thing.
p263_199|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p263_200|We are committed to realising the potential of every child.
p263_201|It is a terrible loss.
p263_202|I think, therefore I am ?
p263_203|Who was she ?
p263_204|Or was it ?
p263_205|And they were being paid ?
p263_206|Two years later, she was dead.
p263_207|It is not easy to live in Russia.
p263_208|It is difficult to comment on the prospects for the year ahead.
p263_209|However, this idea is never developed.
p263_210|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p263_211|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p263_212|It is hard to tell.
p263_213|He should emerge as the winner.
p263_214|I came home by ambulance.
p263_215|This decision was taken with the full support of Scottish ministers.
p263_216|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p263_217|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
p263_218|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p263_219|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p263_220|They are in the euro.
p263_221|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p263_222|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
p263_223|A deadline is still essential.
p263_224|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p263_225|Bombing is the easy option.
p263_226|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
p263_227|Abbey National is an option.
p263_228|We can hardly talk about it.
p263_229|It was located on the remote control.
p263_230|It is safe in our hands.
p263_231|I'm just a regular person.
p263_232|I am considered a teenager.
p263_233|In each case they were a goal down.
p263_234|It's just a normal life.
p263_235|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p263_236|People should make their own decisions.
p263_237|That you can do it.
p263_238|We will reform the welfare state.
p263_239|It could be to do with the location.
p263_241|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p263_242|She will attend in July.
p263_243|The body follows the mind.
p263_244|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
p263_245|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p263_246|That will be the criteria for the future.
p263_247|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p263_248|We were a load of rubbish.
p263_249|He has run a hell of a race.
p263_250|What was the matter for concern ?
p263_251|Do I think about them often ?
p263_252|Is it in the right place ?
p263_253|Did he trip ?
p263_254|Does that put pressure on us ?
p263_255|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p263_256|The deal is expected to be completed by next summer.
p263_257|The irony was not lost.
p263_258|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p263_259|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p263_260|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p263_261|You look like a rugby player.
p263_262|Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
p263_263|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p263_264|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p263_265|You can feel at home in China.
p263_266|We've got a lot of that sort of nonsense in the North-east.
p263_267|The whole point is to get the issue into the open.
p263_268|My son was too young to die.
p263_269|It should have taken a year for a company this size.
p263_270|We were not allowed to go to help them.
p263_271|I didn't see the point.
p263_272|It seems a shame to leave it.
p263_273|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p263_274|I can't get a job.
p263_275|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p263_276|That could be in place by next year.
p263_277|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p263_278|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p263_279|They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
p263_280|They must play for each other.
p263_281|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p263_282|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p263_283|They can leave at any time.
p263_284|I was delighted with the way he jumped.
p263_285|Much of the equipment was new.
p263_286|You get a lot for your money.
p263_287|An announcement will follow in due course.
p263_288|He has not created a Festival resource.
p263_289|He was also married with two children.
p263_291|I was first in the door.
p263_292|Access has been a nightmare.
p263_293|Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
p263_294|It will always be the highlight of my career.
p263_295|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p263_296|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p263_297|She failed in her action.
p263_298|Its body language is all wrong.
p263_299|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p263_300|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p263_301|So the Government will be damaged.
p263_302|I have lost all confidence.
p263_303|John was there already in spirit.
p263_304|In the end, it was no choice.
p263_305|Are they free ?
p263_306|What are they for ?
p263_307|Is there a waiting list ?
p263_308|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p263_309|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p263_310|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p263_311|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p263_312|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p263_313|I have decided to stand down from the list.
p263_314|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p263_315|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
p263_316|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p263_317|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p263_318|Nothing has been put into action.
p263_319|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p263_320|Like many companies, it is a problem.
p263_321|Action must be taken to slow down the traffic.
p263_322|However, a bid was never made.
p263_323|We're not an employment agency.
p263_324|I could not have hoped to run at this level.
p263_325|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p263_326|The following year was a miserable time for Mr Dewar.
p263_327|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
p263_328|They come to enjoy themselves.
p263_329|There's still a bit to go.
p263_330|We have a good healthy debate.
p263_331|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p263_332|It is a court case.
p263_333|The minister is the engineer.
p263_334|There is no plan B.
p263_335|He will go a long way.
p263_336|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p263_337|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p263_338|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p263_339|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p263_340|She is on a life support machine.
p263_341|He is married with three children.
p263_342|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p263_343|It's difficult to predict the future.
p263_344|My body is clearly capable.
p263_345|Tourists are only concerned with the quality of their experience.
p263_346|In the old days, it was easy.
p263_347|The airport was even different.
p263_348|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p263_349|It is the same old story.
p263_350|Analysts were not surprised at the talks between the companies.
p263_351|Overall, we are very pleased.
p263_352|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p263_353|Does it matter ?
p263_354|How do you take them away ?
p263_355|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p263_356|After the match, do you ?
p263_357|The pain was almost too much to bear.
p263_358|Whether this return was too soon.
p263_359|There is a good example in this city.
p263_360|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p263_361|He was then replaced by Ross.
p263_362|That's as it should be.
p263_363|The key player in this matter is now the Prime Minister.
p263_364|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p263_365|There is a range of employers.
p263_366|But we welcome this document.
p263_367|He did a good job.
p263_368|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p263_369|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p263_370|The value of the merger is still there.
p263_371|Nobody else was with me.
p263_372|She would take the Farmer to the opera.
p263_373|They may yet have the last laugh.
p263_374|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p263_375|And I repeat, it would be for exposure and money.
p263_376|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p263_377|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p263_378|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p263_379|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p263_380|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p263_381|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p263_382|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p263_383|The bank was now involved.
p263_384|It was like a weekly wage.
p263_385|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
p263_386|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
p263_387|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p263_388|You have to rely on each other.
p263_389|This season has been a nightmare.
p263_390|I felt the head was very like me.
p263_391|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p263_392|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p263_393|She has a little boy.
p263_394|Theatre is not a museum.
p263_395|I was just happy to get my own goal.
p263_396|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p263_397|The thing is to recognise that chance.
p263_398|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p263_399|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p263_400|They have put in a lot of time and effort.
p263_401|He's in his element and the audience is delighted by him.
p263_402|He replied that it was a dilemma.
p263_403|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p263_404|He said the Parliament should be left to make its own decision.
p263_405|MAN is fully listed on the London Stock Exchange.
p263_406|We must improve our relations with government.
p263_407|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p263_408|It was an amazing afternoon.
p263_409|The casualties were not named.
p263_410|We shall not be moved.
p263_411|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p263_412|It looked like a river.
p263_413|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p263_414|Once again, they were back amongst the big boys.
p263_415|It was important to win the singles.
p263_416|I'm pleased about one thing.
p263_417|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
p263_418|I had a tie in my hand.
p263_419|I can lead by example.
p263_420|Such an attack is bizarre.
p263_421|Today, the story is different.
p263_422|The Queen Mother is dead.
p263_423|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
p263_424|We have received a number of inquiries from interested parties.
p263_425|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p263_426|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
p263_427|But we are severely limited in funds.
p263_428|Together, we can make a difference.
p263_429|It is that sort of film.
p263_430|Mr Reid said the repeal was a sensitive issue.
p263_431|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p263_432|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
p263_433|Which may be the same thing.
p263_434|It is not a standing army.
p263_435|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p263_436|As it turned out it was a triumph.
p263_437|We shall not forget him.
p263_438|I can't wait for the season to end.
p263_439|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p263_440|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p263_441|You have got to be careful.
p263_442|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
p263_443|No decisions have been made in this respect.
p263_444|It wouldn't matter if he had.
p263_445|No, because it was too many.
p263_446|He deserves a second chance.
p263_447|I believed that effort was needed in our own area.
p263_448|It is not over by any means.
p263_449|The second goal was a terrible mistake by our defence.
p263_450|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p263_451|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
p263_452|But we have built a platform for next season.
p263_453|It looked like a war zone.
p264_001|Please call Stella.  )
p264_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
p264_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
p264_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
p264_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )
p264_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
p264_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
p264_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
p264_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
p264_010|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
p264_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
p264_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
p264_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
p264_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
p264_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )
p264_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
p264_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
p264_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
p264_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
p264_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
p264_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
p264_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
p264_025|The west coast line is not just for middle England.)
p264_026|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.)
p264_027|He does not even trust his own members.)
p264_028|We're only taking on a couple just now.)
p264_029|The local primary is excellent.)
p264_030|Do not give your details to anyone.)
p264_031|I feel I did not have enough time.)
p264_032|He added that her comments were noted.)
p264_033|It felt right for me.)
p264_034|We are opening an inquiry.)
p264_035|This remains the case.)
p264_036|Certainly, we do as well.)
p264_037|It carried a double message.)
p264_038|It was a total surprise.)
p264_039|I wish I could see it again.)
p264_040|I am secure in my owns position.)
p264_041|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.)
p264_042|It is a complex deal.)
p264_043|I made my mind up before we came on tour.)
p264_044|It does not stop here.)
p264_045|We're working on it night and day.)
p264_046|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.)
p264_047|The results, out tomorrow, will focus on the company's strategy.)
p264_048|There remains some Scottish influence, however.)
p264_049|I only signed this morning.)
p264_050|The Office is a show about nothing, then.)
p264_051|We were leading by two goals.)
p264_053|It was dangerous but vital employment.)
p264_054|All options are available.)
p264_055|How are you, sir?)
p264_056|So is that it, then?)
p264_057|Do I have a favourite?)
p264_058|What do we do?)
p264_059|Why do it otherwise?)
p264_060|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?)
p264_061|So, did she meet him?)
p264_062|It happens from time to time.)
p264_063|You could very well be.)
p264_064|People come to see the Highlands.)
p264_065|It is nice to be a woman and a wife.)
p264_066|She always put the party first.)
p264_067|Things have just worked out this way.)
p264_068|That is not possible.)
p264_069|This is far too high.)
p264_070|He has real potential.)
p264_071|But I had never been in a theatre.)
p264_072|Without doubt, the debate on education is welcome.)
p264_073|Confidence is as low as it can get.)
p264_074|I think with my experience I can help the team.)
p264_075|That is really all.)
p264_076|The deal was done on Wednesday.)
p264_077|The time has arrived for a review.)
p264_078|That is very important.)
p264_079|Only water is currently allowed.)
p264_080|Put simply, it goes something like this.)
p264_081|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.)
p264_082|It looks that way.)
p264_083|Now comes the hard part.)
p264_084|Maybe they will see sense.)
p264_085|We're at home, which is important.)
p264_086|Because I was a very physical person.)
p264_087|The circumstances have changed since last year.)
p264_088|They're already booked for next year.)
p264_089|The savings can be dramatic.)
p264_090|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.)
p264_091|They are a different team at home.)
p264_092|However this weekend it will be different.)
p264_093|Are you going to win?)
p264_094|What is the wife?)
p264_096|What do we want to do that for?)
p264_097|Does the name matter?)
p264_098|how do you get it back?)
p264_099|What are you not good at?)
p264_100|His massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.)
p264_101|Two of our crew were killed.)
p264_102|I feel confident about the outcome.)
p264_103|The referee had been right.)
p264_104|Jack was always going to win this one.)
p264_105|It would be easy to think so.)
p264_106|You're quite wrong, he said.)
p264_107|I was born for this moment.)
p264_108|I first met him last summer.)
p264_109|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.)
p264_110|You can maintain regular contact.)
p264_112|This makes up for it.)
p264_113|Firm action must be taken.)
p264_114|But they had to be paid for.)
p264_115|That's the bit that's wrong.)
p264_116|Nothing would now surprise me.)
p264_117|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.)
p264_118|But I am in practice.)
p264_119|Trading is tough at the moment.)
p264_120|It came a bit late.)
p264_121|All music goes into me.)
p264_122|That was a great performance by the team.)
p264_123|It seemed like four hours.)
p264_124|The family moved around a lot.)
p264_125|We beat the Welsh team.)
p264_126|An announcement is expected within a few months.)
p264_127|We have a team to reach the final.)
p264_128|Eight others have followed.)
p264_129|These people were my friends.)
p264_130|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.)
p264_131|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.)
p264_132|This commitment should be built upon.)
p264_133|I hope we've reached the bottom now.)
p264_134|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.)
p264_135|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.)
p264_136|However, it's possible that Dick can have influence some Dutch players to go there.)
p264_137|This is a separate announcement which is in a different league.)
p264_138|It's very dangerous for markets.)
p264_139|He said some things which were better left alone.)
p264_140|He nearly killed my son.)
p264_141|That comes at a cost.)
p264_142|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.)
p264_143|I told them during their morning break.)
p264_144|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.)
p264_145|The truth will come out.)
p264_146|Mr Dewar understood that.)
p264_147|She's been shot.)
p264_148|Do I think about them often?)
p264_149|Is it in the right place?)
p264_150|Did he trip?)
p264_151|Does that put pressure on us?)
p264_152|Did it work?)
p264_153|Their moment had come, or so they said.)
p264_154|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.)
p264_155|The second failed completely.)
p264_156|It gives a commitment.)
p264_157|Now it was Britain's turn.)
p264_158|We have come a long way since then.)
p264_159|Sport is good for you.)
p264_160|It was clearly not a battle.)
p264_161|No such meeting took place.)
p264_162|It is just too tough.)
p264_163|There is no doubt there's room for us.)
p264_164|The options seem limited.)
p264_165|It's been my life.)
p264_166|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.)
p264_167|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.)
p264_168|Everything people said about it was true.)
p264_169|I've no idea how it works.)
p264_170|No, but my wife is.)
p264_171|It is a large number.)
p264_172|I'm taking each day as it comes.)
p264_173|Art can challenge our value system.)
p264_174|Now he's back on top again.)
p264_176|No-one wants to talk about death.)
p264_177|Once again, he refused.)
p264_178|We just want this session to end.)
p264_179|You can spend money on housing.)
p264_180|I've never had a year like this.)
p264_181|Neil has worked hard throughout his career.)
p264_182|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.)
p264_183|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.)
p264_184|She really suffered for her art.)
p264_185|The single currency could well lead to a single tax policy.)
p264_186|She runs like her mother.)
p264_187|I remember that day well.)
p264_188|In short, the national team without Frank is like football without feet.)
p264_189|They were certainly tough, but totally fair.)
p264_190|The questions came quick and fast.)
p264_191|We tried four banks.)
p264_192|Is there a waiting list?)
p264_193|Do they think anyone else wants them?)
p264_194|So what happens next?)
p264_195|Had this been common practice?)
p264_196|What do they want us to do?)
p264_197|Is it worth it?)
p264_198|Does it matter?)
p264_199|How do you take them away?)
p264_200|At half-time he was presented to both teams.)
p264_201|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.)
p264_202|I was independent but I am not now.)
p264_203|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.)
p264_204|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.)
p264_205|I saw people on fire.)
p264_206|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.)
p264_207|Both leaders were joined by senior party figures.)
p264_208|Her experience is certainly limited.)
p264_209|The labour side has developed in the North area.)

p264_211|He was a home referee.)
p264_212|Brian was last to join.)
p264_213|It was men against boys.)
p264_214|Three hit the target.)
p264_215|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.)
p264_216|Henry should go now.)
p264_217|Now we have fresh hope.)
p264_218|Life is still very tough for them.)
p264_219|It was a piece of art.)
p264_221|Britain will be little affected.)
p264_222|The two companies were not for sale.)
p264_223|IT has been a tough year for Scottish business.)
p264_224|It was all great training.)
p264_226|No partners would lose their jobs.)
p264_227|I was in daily contact.)
p264_228|He talks too much.)
p264_230|Many changes are positive changes.)
p264_231|This is absolutely not true.)
p264_232|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.)
p264_233|It was a great evening.)
p264_234|However, there is an issue, isn't there?)
p264_235|After the match, do you?)
p264_236|Has the conflict started?)
p264_237|Have I really come to this?)
p264_238|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?)
p264_240|This is a big game for both of us.)
p264_241|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.)
p264_242|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.)
p264_243|Eight months later, he was dead.)
p264_244|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.)
p264_245|I go home only once.)
p264_246|It is based on population rather than need.)
p264_247|Progress, however, is only achieved through hard work and heavy investment.)
p264_248|They were game, but not very good.)
p264_249|I did not vote either way.)
p264_250|We really are a team.)
p264_251|I hit you there.)
p264_252|The pension levels will remain the same.)
p264_253|He is keen to stay in public service.)
p264_254|For that reason cover should not be given.)
p264_255|He felt too close to head office.)
p264_256|We have brought the staff back on board.)
p264_257|We had a right to expect those days were over.)
p264_258|The group's increasing scale will help.)
p264_259|We were looking for a base.)
p264_260|We had a grand view.)
p264_261|Walker declined to put a figure on losses.)
p264_262|They made such decisions in London.)
p264_263|The proposal was rejected.)
p264_264|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.)
p264_265|Some changes have been achieved at great cost.)
p264_266|Everyone wanted him to win.)
p264_267|I was totally wrong.)
p264_268|I may play with two players up, maybe not.)
p264_269|Others get through it.)
p264_270|I knew him well.)
p264_271|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.)
p264_272|All films open tomorrow)
p264_273|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.)
p264_274|The third has yet to be named.)
p264_275|He was called in by the government last year to report on pension reform.)
p264_276|Scots police had been asked to join the search to find him.)
p264_277|People realise we have a job to do.)
p264_278|I'm interested in interesting work.)
p264_279|It would be nice to be involved in another victory.)
p264_280|Sales will begin by the end of October.)
p264_281|He will get his chances.)
p264_282|Friday night was a pretty good night.)
p264_283|She now lives in London.)
p264_284|It's not a small step.)
p264_285|They have the cash and the fire power.)
p264_286|The institute board will take the decision.)
p264_287|He followed the Italian route.)
p264_288|If not, a deal could take many months.)
p264_289|You have made your point.)
p264_290|He died the following year.)
p264_291|We must move on.)
p264_292|It's just an area of water.)
p264_293|Rangers was on the agenda and I am interested.)
p264_294|If so, we want to hear from them.)
p264_295|She doesn't know the half of it.)
p264_296|Perhaps they were right.)
p264_297|Autumn will be a real challenge.)
p264_298|Many events are down on numbers.)
p264_299|He had served his time.)
p264_300|That was around July, August.)
p264_301|The direct effects on trade will be limited.)
p264_302|It changed the very language.)
p264_303|It was finally agreed on Saturday.)
p264_304|I did so, making the positive case for Scottish New Labour.)
p264_305|Only one got through.)
p264_306|He remains a main board director of Royal.)
p264_307|It's not a marketing scheme.)
p264_308|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.)
p264_309|Five years ago its return was rejected.)
p264_310|He left pretty quickly.)
p264_311|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.)
p264_312|They might surprise themselves.)
p264_313|It is his speed off the mark that is so impressive.)
p264_314|Hibs are playing with style now.)
p264_315|Such a policy is for long-term strength.)
p264_316|This is extremely positive news.)
p264_317|Other teams moved up too.)
p264_318|I just felt like a dead loss.)
p264_319|Not one person spoke badly.)
p264_320|The performance continues to improve.)
p264_321|We want immediate action.)
p264_322|Our relationship has been very good.)
p264_323|Someone should tell them.)
p264_324|They really had a go at us.)
p264_325|They should try to get tickets.)
p264_326|The change could come as soon as September.)
p264_327|They emerged before the patients left hospital.)
p264_328|He did not say that.)
p264_329|We are a husband and wife team.)
p264_330|I can't get away from it.)
p264_331|He had played very well.)
p264_332|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.)
p264_333|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.)
p264_334|I saw one man vote five times.)
p264_335|It's quite crucial for me.)
p264_336|This fact is supported by audience research.)
p264_337|The regional government faces key elections next May.)
p264_339|Time remains to put other candidates forward.)
p264_340|In Great Britain, it has a life of its own.)
p264_341|This deal is a great boost for the Borders.)
p264_342|An opera company needs to have its orchestra.)
p264_343|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.)
p264_344|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.)
p264_345|I believe they are dead.)
p264_346|We have no information on Iraq.)
p264_347|We had to approach it the way we feel we can do best.)
p264_348|It looks at public interest issues.)
p264_349|The book is closed.)
p264_350|I would be very keen on a move to Italy.)
p264_351|He is fully fit.)
p264_352|That would concern me lot.)
p264_353|It's clearly a budget.)
p264_354|Both watched her win yesterday.)
p264_355|Her father had died recently.)
p264_356|We accept the new rules.)
p264_357|Neil knows the score.)
p264_358|He could still be President.)
p264_359|It had been introduced over six years.)
p264_360|Blair is very positive at European Councils.)
p264_361|It shows we're not much of a rugby country.)
p264_362|Her body has never been found.)
p264_363|The purchase was widely criticised by both analysts and investors.)
p264_364|They had to have hospital treatment.)
p264_365|I would never even consider it.)
p264_366|Five local people were injured.)
p264_367|It has helped focus attention on junior golf.)
p264_368|We've had some pretty bad times.)
p264_369|That is for white people.)
p264_370|Neither had any other career.)
p264_371|Without rules, the elections could not go ahead, he stressed.)
p264_372|I took my chance.)
p264_373|It has the potential to be another North Sea.)
p264_374|It was exactly four months away.)
p264_375|We have a high quality product.)
p264_376|He was always Scottish Labour, or simply Labour.)
p264_377|It would have to look for outside funding.)
p264_378|John gave up everything to be with me.)
p264_379|He had wanted to play, but we had to be responsible about the decision we took.)
p264_380|I have been going through a lot of things.)
p264_381|People could have a post box in the local post office.)
p264_382|If we get a penalty next week I want to take it.)
p264_383|This is too much like Scotland.)
p264_385|His third child was born in April.)
p264_386|They want the style of the sound changed a bit.)
p264_387|Young people will always run away.)
p264_388|The view is impressive.)
p264_389|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.)
p264_390|It is the same with Barry.)
p264_391|The experts got it wrong.)
p264_392|We have done our own tests.)
p264_393|No, because they look good boys.)
p264_394|His deal is effective for two years, starting in July.)
p264_395|We learned two things.)
p264_396|It has been only average.)
p264_397|It was either Wednesday or Thursday, he said.)
p264_398|It was an attitude thing.)
p264_399|But it is her picture.)
p264_400|The tickets are on their way.)
p264_401|He plays only for himself.)
p264_402|They have quick front players, but so do we.)
p264_403|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.)
p264_404|It was that kind of match.)
p264_405|Good records have always been recognised by successful farmers.)
p264_406|The songs are just so good.)
p264_407|So I moved on.)
p264_408|That view was confirmed by Welsh coach Graham Henry.)
p264_409|You took the law into your own hands.)
p264_410|But British scientists were not convinced by the findings.)
p264_411|They like big name players.)
p264_412|Financial services also saw a sharp reduction in new business.)
p264_413|Williams said the same.)
p264_414|I was the sheep.)
p264_415|I've learned a huge amount from Michael.)
p264_416|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.)
p264_417|A report will be issued by March.)
p264_418|The legislation is expected to be introduced next spring.)
p264_419|We didn't really have to power up.)
p264_420|He is very fast all right.)
p264_421|They could change them tomorrow.)
p264_422|We have some options there.)
p264_423|This man must be helped to keep his arm.)
p264_424|Our performance wasn't perfect.)
p264_425|Those overseas offices were great.)
p264_426|She had black eyes.)
p264_427|In practice, the economic tests have to be met.)
p264_428|I have to protect them.)
p264_429|The people are nice, though.)
p264_430|Equipment is also a problem.)
p264_431|We cannot ask for them back.)
p264_432|The tie isn't over.)
p264_433|He doesn't need to hit people.)
p264_434|A job is a job, after all.)
p264_435|It all came good.)
p264_436|It was a hard fight.)
p264_437|Special measures were needed.)
p264_438|However, the proposal is not aimed at rugby, but at all sports.)
p264_439|Colin Cameron was excellent.)
p264_440|That approach has passed its sell by date.)
p264_441|Sir George said every company in the country has this issue at the moment.)
p264_442|WE all watch the same match.)
p264_443|We would deal first with the biggest party.)
p264_444|The company was set up six years ago.)
p264_445|It was an outstanding performance.)
p264_446|The three previous winners also came from Scotland.)
p264_447|In the old days, it was easy.)
p264_448|Powers looks straight ahead.)
p264_449|The festival runs until Tuesday.)
p264_450|We are unable to provide support for future issues.)
p264_451|These days are past.)
p264_452|The official also said no groups had made any terrorist claims involving the crash.)
p264_453|They finished second and third.)
p264_454|He was then replaced by Ross.)
p264_455|They thought he was asking the right questions.)
p264_456|It had been accepted.)
p264_457|The truth was rather different.)
p264_458|The technology looks excellent.)
p264_459|The party had high hopes of taking the seat from Labour.)
p264_460|We have very limited capacity.)
p264_461|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.)
p264_462|They're interested only in profits.)
p264_463|That does not take much training.)
p264_464|Scotland needs this award.)
p264_465|He enjoyed being with his family.)
p264_466|It's a strategy which would work beyond this show.)
p264_467|This is a big advantage.)
p264_468|He dismissed the action.)
p264_469|If they gave me free electricity I still wouldn't support the plans.)
p264_470|It is an industry failure.)
p264_471|Each year they cut them down a bit.)
p264_472|We showed some spirit against Newcastle.)
p264_473|It's a tough old job to get for your first job.)
p264_474|I've got to win here to be happy.)
p264_475|I'm delighted for Andy.)
p265_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p265_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p265_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p265_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p265_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p265_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p265_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p265_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p265_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p265_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p265_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p265_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p265_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p265_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p265_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p265_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p265_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p265_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p265_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p265_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p265_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p265_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p265_025|Is this accurate?
p265_026|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p265_027|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p265_028|This is the window.
p265_029|We speak about the performance.
p265_030|It's a fact.
p265_031|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p265_032|It has failed.
p265_033|It was clear.
p265_034|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p265_035|Indeed, he does.
p265_036|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p265_037|Dancing was her life.
p265_038|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p265_039|It's the only thing.
p265_040|This represents a tough game for us.
p265_041|A neighbour said.
p265_042|Among them are many criminals.
p265_043|She looked so young.
p265_044|This is a club on the rise.
p265_045|I guess I was lucky, though.
p265_046|There was no safety net.
p265_047|It is unique.
p265_048|I expect a rapid response.
p265_049|TODAY it begins.
p265_050|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p265_051|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p265_052|It's that kind of place.
p265_053|They are real.
p265_054|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p265_055|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p265_056|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p265_057|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p265_058|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p265_059|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p265_060|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p265_061|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
p265_063|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p265_064|Neither it is.
p265_065|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p265_066|Is there a new way forward?
p265_067|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p265_068|The results are tragic.
p265_069|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p265_070|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p265_071|What has changed?
p265_072|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p265_073|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p265_074|A play is a set of actions.
p265_075|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p265_076|By then, he was walking on water.
p265_077|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p265_078|They lived for their children.
p265_079|It will be tight.
p265_080|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p265_081|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p265_082|It is a lifeline.
p265_083|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p265_084|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p265_085|This one did.
p265_086|They are now divorced.
p265_087|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p265_088|I saw the whole thing.
p265_089|It was mayhem.
p265_090|Journalists should make him.
p265_091|It is a love affair.
p265_092|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p265_093|May not have been at fault?
p265_094|They tried to deny it.
p265_095|We have an election in eight days.
p265_096|Oil embargo endorsed.
p265_097|He takes the job.
p265_098|She reflects a bit.
p265_099|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p265_100|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
p265_101|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
p265_102|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p265_103|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p265_104|It's a shame.
p265_105|It was the eighties.
p265_106|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p265_107|You had better believe it.
p265_108|It is rubbish.
p265_109|Who would be a referee?
p265_110|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p265_111|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p265_112|That's all right then.
p265_113|I'm so angry.
p265_114|Holland won by five wickets.
p265_115|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p265_116|Twaddle is a case in point.
p265_117|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p265_118|It plans to return to this field.
p265_119|They took a risk.
p265_120|We work well together.
p265_121|What will happen then?
p265_122|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p265_123|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p265_124|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p265_125|Is that it?
p265_126|It is a time bomb.
p265_127|I was dead.
p265_128|I don't know the full story.
p265_129|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p265_130|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p265_131|She died at her home.
p265_132|He realises his mistake.
p265_133|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p265_134|The idea is simple.
p265_135|That group reported just before Christmas.
p265_136|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p265_137|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p265_138|You know the type.
p265_139|I was stunned.
p265_140|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p265_141|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p265_142|They have not been named.
p265_143|We are now up against it.
p265_144|We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
p265_145|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p265_146|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p265_147|Well, he should know.
p265_148|I will tell you.
p265_149|I've put my own money into this project.
p265_150|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p265_151|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p265_152|It has to be now.
p265_153|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p265_154|It is not like us.
p265_155|Seven people were later detained by police.
p265_156|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p265_157|They will do their own thing.
p265_158|You had to go and see him.
p265_159|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p265_160|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p265_161|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p265_162|Blair's response was weak.
p265_163|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p265_164|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p265_165|It is not either national standards or local control.
p265_166|He deserved the win.
p265_167|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p265_168|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p265_169|They know no other way.
p265_170|I've been there.
p265_171|It's an idea.
p265_172|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p265_173|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p265_174|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p265_175|They need to look after themselves.
p265_176|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p265_177|Does this matter?
p265_178|One was a lawyer.
p265_179|I put the drawing down.
p265_180|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p265_181|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p265_182|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p265_183|It is a farce.
p265_184|Peace was won.
p265_185|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p265_186|It was very frightened and dirty.
p265_187|Is that success?
p265_188|The service from the other players was super.
p265_189|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p265_190|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p265_191|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p265_192|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p265_193|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p265_194|It's all about money, money, money.
p265_195|It was worth a photograph.
p265_196|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p265_197|I don't want to use it.
p265_198|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p265_199|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p265_200|I had decided to quit the show.
p265_201|People must remain vigilant.
p265_202|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p265_203|He seemed to lose his focus.
p265_204|I might come back.
p265_205|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p265_206|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p265_207|Because they didn't want to know.
p265_208|That has been the easy part.
p265_209|But she was.
p265_210|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p265_211|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p265_212|I'd never seen a play about me.
p265_213|It's not before time.
p265_214|The report is due out next month.
p265_215|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p265_216|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p265_217|At the time, he was a living legend.
p265_218|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p265_219|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p265_220|We were awful.
p265_221|We are so proud.
p265_222|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p265_223|I can leave at the end of the day.
p265_224|Until they came to do it.
p265_225|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p265_226|Wealth is relative.
p265_227|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p265_228|You should be.
p265_229|It's quite nice.
p265_230|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p265_231|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p265_232|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p265_233|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p265_234|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p265_235|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p265_236|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p265_237|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p265_238|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p265_239|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p265_240|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p265_241|It was a hit.
p265_242|There's the mix.
p265_243|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p265_244|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p265_245|That could be in place by next year.
p265_246|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p265_247|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p265_248|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p265_249|Chelsea was a great club.
p265_250|We have to expand.
p265_251|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p265_252|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p265_253|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p265_254|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p265_255|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p265_256|Souter will be back.
p265_257|I am just trying to do my job.
p265_258|Blood samples were taken.
p265_259|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p265_260|This is a question of Islam.
p265_262|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p265_263|It's a way of life.
p265_264|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p265_265|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p265_266|They seem to get away with it.
p265_267|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p265_268|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p265_269|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p265_270|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p265_271|We have to break that cycle.
p265_272|He looked very sharp.
p265_273|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p265_274|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p265_275|You've got to have both sides.
p265_276|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p265_277|Dialogue is the key.
p265_278|It was a virus.
p265_279|Yet, it worked.
p265_280|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p265_281|This is a national crisis.
p265_282|Who did the recruiting?
p265_283|So I did.
p265_284|We are not going to forget.
p265_285|What has altered?
p265_286|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p265_287|There is no openness.
p265_288|I can live with it.
p265_289|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p265_290|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p265_291|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p265_292|Last night was a key episode.
p265_293|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p265_294|You are the glory.
p265_295|The minister is the engineer.
p265_296|The letters are going out today.
p265_297|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way around.
p265_298|Is there on his hands?
p265_299|We are a peaceful people.
p265_300|Kids are terrible.
p265_301|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p265_302|My body is clearly capable.
p265_303|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p265_304|They had a confession.
p265_305|It will work.
p265_306|I came into this world with nothing.
p265_307|It's too horrible to think.
p265_308|Either team will be hard.
p265_309|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p265_310|My view has now completely changed.
p265_311|The party is up for it.
p265_312|Is that an issue?
p265_313|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p265_314|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p265_315|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p265_316|Who will do it?
p265_317|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p265_318|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p265_319|Two people were interviewed.
p265_320|I'm very lucky.
p265_321|It's very good.
p265_322|This is a friendly match?
p265_323|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p265_324|They should take their mobile phones.
p265_325|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p265_326|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p265_327|Tell us about it.
p265_328|She said they would appeal.
p265_329|But we finished the show.
p265_330|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p265_331|There is no excuse.
p265_332|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p266_001|Please call Stella.
p266_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p266_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p266_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p266_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p266_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p266_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p266_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p266_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p266_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p266_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p266_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p266_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p266_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p266_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p266_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p266_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p266_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p266_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p266_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p266_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p266_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p266_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p266_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p266_025|She looked so young.
p266_026|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p266_027|Is this accurate?
p266_028|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p266_029|There's a story, too.
p266_030|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p266_031|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p266_032|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p266_033|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p266_034|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p266_035|It was clear.
p266_036|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p266_037|Indeed, he does.
p266_038|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p266_039|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p266_040|Dancing was her life.
p266_041|It's the only thing.
p266_042|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p266_043|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p266_044|A neighbour said.
p266_045|Among them are many criminals.
p266_046|Is a drug dealer?
p266_047|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p266_048|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p266_049|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p266_050|There was a substantial explosion.
p266_051|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p266_052|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p266_053|I expect a rapid response.
p266_054|What was the main difference?
p266_055|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p266_056|They're appalled by that.
p266_057|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p266_058|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p266_059|We should have known.
p266_060|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p266_061|We recorded it at our own expense.
p266_062|Try to save us.
p266_063|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p266_064|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p266_065|Painful, but only because it's true.
p266_066|He was at home with his pals.
p266_067|It's all I can do.
p266_068|I was as strong as a horse.
p266_069|Then followed a bout of flu.
p266_070|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p266_071|Neither it is.
p266_072|It is a job creation scheme.
p266_073|It works for us.
p266_074|The party is up for it.
p266_075|Even the one she loved.
p266_076|Today she has been released.
p266_077|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p266_078|I will miss him.
p266_079|He is in the queue.
p266_080|I first met him last summer.
p266_081|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p266_082|He is driven.
p266_083|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p266_084|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p266_085|Someone who cares
p266_086|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p266_087|They lived for their children.
p266_088|It will be tight.
p266_089|It is a lifeline.
p266_090|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
p266_091|It's good news.
p266_092|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p266_093|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p266_094|I love the Dome.
p266_095|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p266_096|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p266_097|I saw the whole thing.
p266_098|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p266_099|Journalists should make him.
p266_100|May not have been at fault?
p266_101|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p266_102|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p266_103|That would be unlawful.
p266_104|Oil embargo endorsed.
p266_105|He takes the job.
p266_106|She reflects a bit.
p266_107|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p266_108|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p266_109|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p266_110|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p266_111|It was a funny game.
p266_112|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p266_113|Is that right?
p266_114|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p266_115|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p266_116|It's a shame.
p266_117|It was the eighties.
p266_118|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p266_119|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p266_120|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p266_121|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p266_122|Who would have?
p266_123|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p266_124|There were no grounds for his action.
p266_125|I'm so angry.
p266_126|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p266_127|I was on a roll.
p266_128|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p266_129|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
p266_130|We work well together.
p266_131|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p266_132|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p266_133|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p266_134|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p266_135|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p266_136|Is that it?
p266_137|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p266_138|I was dead.
p266_139|I don't know the full story.
p266_140|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p266_141|Who would be right?
p266_142|She died at her home.
p266_143|He realises his mistake.
p266_144|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p266_145|I was awful.
p266_146|That group reported just before Christmas.
p266_147|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p266_148|It is not just about pay.
p266_149|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p266_150|So I got a blood test.
p266_151|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p266_152|The weather forecast isn't good.
p266_153|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p266_154|They have not been named.
p266_155|I might come back.
p266_156|We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
p266_157|My Dad is a hero.
p266_158|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p266_159|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p266_160|There's a pause.
p266_161|Was this element always there?
p266_162|I've put my own money into this project.
p266_163|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p266_164|We need a new kind of theatre.
p266_165|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p266_166|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p266_167|We try to keep it right.
p266_168|Seven people were later detained by police.
p266_169|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p266_170|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p266_171|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p266_172|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p266_173|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p266_174|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p266_175|One season, they might do well.
p266_176|Is Saddam a threat?
p266_177|As we worked.
p266_178|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p266_179|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p266_180|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p266_181|I've been there.
p266_182|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p266_183|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p266_184|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p266_186|What has caused the demise of singing?
p266_187|Our team is just so young.
p266_188|O Neill has delivered.
p266_189|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p266_190|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p266_191|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p266_192|I came home by ambulance.
p266_193|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p266_194|Is that success?
p266_195|The service from the other players was super.
p266_196|Tommy is not a problem.
p266_197|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p266_198|Who will pay for this?
p266_199|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p266_200|It's just awful.
p266_201|It's all about money, money, money.
p266_202|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p266_203|He knows a lot.
p266_204|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p266_205|It had all been arranged.
p266_206|It's not before time.
p266_207|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p266_208|We want to keep the pound.
p266_209|I was so nervous.
p266_210|He seemed to lose his focus.
p266_211|Work has started.
p266_212|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p266_213|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p266_214|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p266_215|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p266_216|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p266_217|Saturday is gone.
p266_218|Because they didn't want to know.
p266_219|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p266_220|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p266_221|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p266_222|I will win.
p266_223|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p266_224|The report is due out next month.
p266_225|We were awful.
p266_226|They tried to give her advice.
p266_227|They have now become the focus of a huge police inquiry.
p266_228|They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
p266_229|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p266_230|There is no excuse.
p266_231|It's quite nice.
p266_232|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p266_233|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p266_234|It's a killer piece.
p266_235|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p266_236|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p266_237|It is hard won.
p266_238|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p266_239|You can feel at home in China.
p266_240|The scene is about this?
p266_241|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p266_242|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p266_243|My son was too young to die.
p266_244|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p266_245|I should think so, too.
p266_246|It was a hit.
p266_247|There's the mix.
p266_248|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p266_249|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p266_250|We are in a war.
p266_251|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p266_252|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p266_253|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p266_254|It was like the old days.
p266_255|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p266_256|Chelsea was a great club.
p266_257|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p266_258|We have to expand.
p266_259|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p266_260|Souter will be back.
p266_261|Note the date.
p266_262|It will be done in stages.
p266_263|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p266_264|You take a risk.
p266_265|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p266_266|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p266_267|He was also married with two children.
p266_268|The system can work.
p266_269|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p266_270|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p266_271|We're in shock.
p266_272|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p266_273|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p266_274|That goes back a long way.
p266_275|It was very fast.
p266_276|She failed in her action.
p266_277|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p266_278|They seem to get away with it.
p266_279|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p266_280|It's so awful.
p266_281|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p266_282|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p266_283|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p266_284|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p266_285|Dialogue is the key.
p266_286|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p266_287|Tony Blair said as little.
p266_288|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p266_289|It was good.
p266_290|Who did the recruiting?
p266_291|Bombing slaughter rejected
p266_292|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p266_293|It could well be military.
p266_294|No Briton has ever won.
p266_295|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p266_296|Spent three months alone at sea.
p266_297|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p266_298|There was a vacuum.
p266_299|We lost a boy.
p266_300|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p266_301|I was brought up in a mining background.
p266_302|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p266_303|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p266_304|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p266_305|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p266_306|I can give no comment.
p266_307|But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
p266_308|This is a war over our home.
p266_309|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p266_310|The plot is minimal.
p266_311|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p266_312|You should be.
p266_313|The minister is the engineer.
p266_314|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p266_315|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p266_316|Your father was a good man.
p266_317|We are a peaceful people.
p266_318|You may have a short memory.
p266_319|The problems began a long time ago.
p266_320|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p266_321|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p266_322|A review is under way.
p266_323|We are in the end game.
p266_324|It's too horrible to think.
p266_325|The airport was even different.
p266_326|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p266_327|There was no time scale.
p266_328|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p266_329|Is there a new way forward?
p266_330|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p266_331|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p266_332|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p266_333|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p266_334|Who will do it?
p266_335|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p266_336|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p266_337|Two people were interviewed.
p266_338|We've tried every other way.
p266_339|This is a big advantage.
p266_340|Maloney was asked.
p266_341|But I was knocked out by the city.
p266_342|went on sale.
p266_343|I'm very lucky.
p266_344|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p266_345|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p266_346|It is long gone.
p266_347|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p266_348|Tell us about it.
p266_349|There may be reasons for it.
p266_350|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p266_351|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p266_352|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p266_353|She is free.
p266_354|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p266_355|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p266_356|Yet he left a few days later.
p266_357|You have to rely on each other.
p266_358|It was one in the afternoon.
p266_359|We will be homeless.
p266_360|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p266_361|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p266_362|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p266_363|This is a club on the rise.
p266_364|Not so, it seems.
p266_365|He was also a great man.
p266_366|He could make it.
p266_367|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p266_368|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p266_369|It's now down in black and white.
p266_370|Twaddle is a case in point.
p266_371|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p266_372|It is a simple equation.
p266_373|So there, we won.
p266_374|But I managed.
p266_375|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p266_376|There is no signature.
p266_377|The task is enormous.
p266_378|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p266_379|I am a wealthy person.
p266_380|Colour was at the core of his life.
p266_381|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p266_382|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p266_384|It's like a car crash.
p266_385|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p266_386|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p266_387|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p266_388|Does that put pressure on us?
p266_389|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p266_390|It is unusual.
p266_391|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p266_392|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
p266_393|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p266_394|They are good.
p266_395|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p266_396|It was a breathtaking moment.
p266_397|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p266_398|What happened in the summer?
p266_399|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p266_400|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p266_401|Emotions were complex.
p266_402|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p266_403|So I did.
p266_404|It's an absolute nonsense.
p267_001|Please call Stella.
p267_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p267_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p267_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p267_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p267_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p267_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p267_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p267_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p267_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p267_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p267_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p267_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p267_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p267_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p267_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p267_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p267_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p267_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p267_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p267_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p267_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
p267_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p267_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p267_025|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p267_026|He may not need to force that message.
p267_027|There is no reason at all.
p267_028|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p267_029|Because we do not need it.
p267_030|We will look into it.
p267_031|This is a central issue.
p267_032|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p267_033|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p267_034|I became a widow overnight.
p267_035|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p267_036|A week is a long time in politics.
p267_037|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p267_038|This represents a tough game for us.
p267_039|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p267_040|It is difficult for Ali.
p267_041|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p267_042|He is too weak to move.
p267_043|Everything else is a bonus.
p267_044|This is the interesting part.
p267_045|I guess I was lucky, though.
p267_046|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p267_047|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p267_048|There was no safety net.
p267_049|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p267_050|It is a different animal.
p267_051|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p267_052|I must take a seat.
p267_053|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p267_054|Four other charges were dropped.
p267_055|So I liked the challenge.
p267_056|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p267_057|That way I won't have to do anything.
p267_058|It's just the timing of the game.
p267_059|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p267_060|We need to increase the membership.
p267_061|He was at home with his pals.
p267_062|They are in the euro.
p267_063|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p267_064|How are you, sir ?
p267_065|So is that it, then ?
p267_066|Do I have a favourite ?
p267_067|There could be a way back.
p267_068|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p267_069|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p267_070|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p267_071|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p267_072|A government is a government is a government.
p267_073|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p267_074|That is bound to happen.
p267_075|He is in the queue.
p267_076|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p267_077|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p267_078|He can win every week.
p267_079|By then, he was walking on water.
p267_080|It's so hard to shift.
p267_081|They lived for their children.
p267_082|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
p267_083|There was no way back for United after that.
p267_084|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p267_085|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p267_086|They need to find a form of words.
p267_087|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p267_088|It's for that reason he should resign.
p267_089|The rescue package is public money.
p267_090|Before the game we went for a pint.
p267_091|Our house was very small.
p267_092|They were a lovely couple.
p267_093|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p267_094|It's not a lack of effort.
p267_095|That means an extra two years.
p267_096|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p267_097|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p267_098|Sport is good for you.
p267_099|We need to handle it.
p267_100|They will notice a difference.
p267_102|Such actions are rarely popular.
p267_103|He has done that with a great deal to spare.
p267_104|Then again, we could have.
p267_105|She's got to say something.
p267_106|I was always a little behind.
p267_107|There were no grounds for his action.
p267_108|That admission is not surprising.
p267_109|We have a training class.
p267_110|Well, you can have a tree.
p267_111|Becoming a father was wonderful.
p267_112|I was on a roll.
p267_113|What do we do ?
p267_114|Why do it otherwise ?
p267_115|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p267_116|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p267_117|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
p267_118|We did what we had to do.
p267_119|I am the Son of Sam.
p267_120|You've got to be vigilant.
p267_121|Tiger is not the norm.
p267_122|My conscience is not clear.
p267_123|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p267_124|It would make a lot of sense.
p267_125|They could use a boost.
p267_126|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p267_127|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p267_128|They scored with a penalty and a breakaway.
p267_129|He was seen as the enemy.
p267_130|That group reported just before Christmas.
p267_131|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p267_132|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p267_133|It was a piece of art.
p267_134|I am just trying to do my job.
p267_135|So I got a blood test.
p267_136|It has become a way of life.
p267_137|I was caught out a little bit.
p267_138|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p267_139|It has to be an event.
p267_140|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p267_141|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p267_142|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p267_143|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p267_144|It was by the numbers.
p267_145|We will turn the corner.
p267_146|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p267_147|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p267_148|There was a definite prejudice.
p267_149|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p267_150|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p267_151|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p267_152|That is not too bad.
p267_153|We are still getting over it.
p267_154|As, indeed, they would be.
p267_155|We came across the first set of bodies.
p267_156|Seven people were later detained by police.
p267_157|I would probably have to agree with him.
p267_158|We were given a warm and friendly reception.
p267_159|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p267_160|Nobody did in those days.
p267_161|So what is the campaign about ?
p267_162|And does it ?
p267_163|Are you from the rugby ?
p267_164|Had I heard ?
p267_165|Well, this article is a bit like that.
p267_166|It's nice to be nice.
p267_167|The people are the hero.
p267_168|I always felt they played for me.
p267_169|It is premature to speculate on the impact.
p267_170|They made such decisions in London.
p267_171|It is a body blow.
p267_172|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p267_173|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p267_174|It is not a threat.
p267_175|I would not count on it.
p267_176|He played it like a veteran.
p267_177|I have spoken to head office.
p267_178|The referee had a good game.
p267_179|The European Union is a case in point.
p267_180|They need to look after themselves.
p267_181|It is a common problem.
p267_182|A team is a team.
p267_183|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p267_184|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p267_185|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p267_186|A terrorist is a terrorist.
p267_187|People will ask about us.
p267_188|I had come back from London.
p267_189|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p267_190|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p267_191|Final proposals will be published in February.
p267_192|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
p267_193|If I was a woman.
p267_194|I came home by ambulance.
p267_195|I suggest a new plan.
p267_196|The conference is the first test.
p267_197|Tommy is not a problem.
p267_198|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p267_199|He had suffered a heart attack.
p267_200|I won't make an official complaint.
p267_201|A bit of match fitness is required.
p267_202|It is an impressive record.
p267_203|There is no quick fix.
p267_204|Abbey National is an option.
p267_205|It has been like that all year for me.
p267_206|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p267_207|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p267_208|From there, they can go anywhere.
p267_209|I had relied on him.
p267_210|The course has helped a lot.
p267_211|I'm just a regular person.
p267_212|My life is in the ballet.
p267_213|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p267_214|They're going to open in early summer.
p267_215|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p267_216|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p267_217|It is good for our team.
p267_218|It was a crazy day.
p267_219|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
p267_220|Because they didn't want to know.
p267_221|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p267_222|You have to do your research.
p267_223|What do we want to do that for ?
p267_224|Does the name matter ?
p267_225|how do you get it back ?
p267_226|What are you not good at ?
p267_227|William Hague delighted his party.
p267_228|You could feel the heat.
p267_229|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
p267_230|The boy is no longer with us.
p267_231|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p267_232|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p267_233|My wife and family are the support system.
p267_234|And he goes with it.
p267_235|They tried to give her advice.
p267_236|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p267_237|She died in middle age.
p267_238|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p267_239|Those overseas offices were great.
p267_240|You will have seen the adverts.
p267_242|It is the loss of my name.
p267_243|The irony was not lost.
p267_244|We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
p267_245|I am still waiting for a reply.
p267_246|It is a court case.
p267_247|He has been a success this year.
p267_248|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p267_249|He declined to give any details.
p267_250|It seems a waste of talents.
p267_251|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p267_252|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
p267_253|His is a global perspective.
p267_254|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p267_255|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p267_256|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p267_257|It was a cry for help.
p267_258|They were back in full training yesterday.
p267_259|No production contract is yet in sight.
p267_260|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p267_261|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p267_262|The capital costs are modest.
p267_263|It was the climax of the thing.
p267_264|I can't get a job.
p267_265|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p267_266|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p267_267|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p267_268|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p267_269|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p267_270|It is also very valuable.
p267_271|It disappeared into the cup.
p267_272|The stage was set for a showdown.
p267_273|Not many companies can say that these days.
p267_274|He will emerge as a world leader.
p267_275|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p267_276|A lot of their players have developed in the English league.
p267_277|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p267_278|It is set in Paris.
p267_279|He has run a hell of a race.
p267_280|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p267_281|He was also married with two children.
p267_282|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p267_283|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p267_284|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p267_285|That goes back a long way.
p267_286|And they were being paid ?
p267_287|was everything done to save people ?
p267_288|What was the matter for concern ?
p267_289|Do I think about them often ?
p267_290|Stephen will get his first cap.
p267_291|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p267_292|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p267_293|We have a plan in place.
p267_294|I felt like I was a child.
p267_295|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p267_296|He wants to talk a lot.
p267_297|The attacker died in the crash.
p267_298|It is inherent in society.
p267_299|He refused to name the survivors.
p267_300|It's difficult to predict the future.
p267_301|That is the general feeling.
p267_302|I am a retailer by nature.
p267_303|Well, he can do it.
p267_304|The weather forecast isn't good.
p267_305|The judge was really nice.
p267_306|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p267_307|It is a potential danger.
p267_308|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p267_309|Cast Away now on general release.
p267_310|It is a road of death.
p267_311|We will make a statement tomorrow.
p267_312|There were no passengers on board.
p267_313|You will never get a conviction.
p267_314|I will not be afraid.
p267_316|He has left the company.
p267_317|I am not concerned with protection of the public.
p267_318|People can really get themselves in a mess.
p267_319|I would do away with the dress code.
p267_320|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p267_321|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
p267_322|We want to play at the worlds.
p267_323|After some discussion they did.
p267_325|It is all credit to them today.
p267_326|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
p267_327|You are looking at him.
p267_328|This is a source of real concern for the area.
p267_329|It's not an easy life.
p267_330|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p267_331|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p267_332|The problems began a long time ago.
p267_333|It makes a compelling display.
p267_334|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p267_335|But the New Year was special.
p267_336|They are now out in the cold.
p267_337|There was no time scale.
p267_338|Does that put pressure on us ?
p267_339|Did it work ?
p267_340|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p267_341|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p267_342|It is a strong case.
p267_343|A report is expected next month.
p267_344|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
p267_345|They were the acts of men.
p267_346|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
p267_347|He was then replaced by Ross.
p267_348|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p267_349|He is not very big, either.
p267_350|I have a moral dilemma.
p267_351|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p267_352|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p267_353|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p267_354|Some will be deployed on submarines.
p267_355|He did a good job.
p267_356|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
p267_357|It is a stroke of genius.
p267_358|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p267_359|We live on an island.
p267_360|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p267_361|They have created a business.
p267_362|I got a yellow card.
p267_363|I am considered a teenager.
p267_364|There may be reasons for it.
p267_365|This is a major championship.
p267_366|It's only a matter of scale.
p267_367|She is now on the back benches.
p267_368|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p267_369|There is no deal as yet.
p267_370|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p267_371|to have products for their needs.
p267_372|The pair are very much in love.
p267_373|They are used to the big stage.
p267_374|The marshall at the turn was great.
p267_375|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p267_376|The seller was not revealed.
p267_377|People are on the alert.
p267_378|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p267_379|In fact, he was great today.
p267_380|We operate as a Scottish company.
p267_381|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p267_382|A review is under way.
p267_383|They have not done so this season so far.
p267_384|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p267_385|Safety was also an issue.
p267_386|We have made no final decisions.
p267_387|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
p267_388|The results will take second place.
p267_389|It was a funny game.
p267_390|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p267_391|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p267_392|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p267_393|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p267_394|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p267_395|We shall not be moved.
p267_396|I watch the other visitors.
p267_397|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p267_398|There were no plans for a rights issue.
p267_399|That's all I can say.
p267_400|Are they free ?
p267_401|What are they for ?
p268_001|Please call Stella.
p268_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p268_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p268_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p268_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p268_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p268_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p268_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p268_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p268_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p268_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p268_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p268_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p268_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p268_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p268_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p268_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p268_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p268_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p268_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p268_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p268_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p268_025|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
p268_026|He got very close tonight.
p268_027|Smoking is also very important.
p268_028|Wages and salaries account for a major proportion of our expenses.
p268_029|The first appeared to be successful.
p268_030|We must convince the citizens.
p268_031|Carlton also declined to comment last night.
p268_032|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p268_033|Further management changes are planned.
p268_034|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p268_035|It's as we were yesterday.
p268_036|We are opening an inquiry.
p268_037|He works at the airport.
p268_038|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p268_039|How are you, sir ?
p268_040|So is that it, then ?
p268_041|Do I have a favourite ?
p268_042|What do we do ?
p268_043|Why do it otherwise ?
p268_044|However, the purchase is as yet unproven.
p268_045|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p268_046|Something has to give sometime.
p268_047|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p268_048|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p268_049|The latter option was chosen.
p268_050|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p268_051|The man became a reporter.
p268_052|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
p268_053|The thought of playing in the English Premiership has tremendous appeal.
p268_054|Among them are many criminals.
p268_055|I knew my contract was up this year.
p268_056|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
p268_057|But it couldn't happen overnight.
p268_058|It was just too much for us.
p268_059|Perhaps we should do the same.
p268_060|They desperately want some stability.
p268_061|Everything is possible in football.
p268_062|He looks like an Afghan.
p268_063|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p268_064|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p268_065|He will need that machine.
p268_066|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p268_067|I would not say that.
p268_068|This was a far cry from his election pledges.
p268_069|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p268_070|The regional newspapers have outperformed the national titles.
p268_071|A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
p268_072|We deserved the three points.
p268_073|The wingers must have felt the cold.
p268_074|I am relishing the challenge.
p268_075|Let's hope that it does.
p268_076|But the organisers refused to worry.
p268_077|We have to keep our clients.
p268_078|We should be able to cope.
p268_079|He also had a Scottish grandfather.
p268_080|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
p268_081|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p268_082|But I had never been in a theatre.
p268_083|He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
p268_084|Kenny Miller might come through.
p268_085|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
p268_086|He's not getting into any games.
p268_087|We will pay their bills.
p268_088|It is time for new ways for the church.
p268_089|It was exactly four months away.
p268_090|I am glad I wasn't in it.
p268_091|THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
p268_092|In fact, I have even had a bet on them.
p268_093|Final proposals will be published in February.
p268_094|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p268_095|So, did she meet him ?
p268_096|So what is the campaign about ?
p268_097|And does it ?
p268_098|Are you from the rugby ?
p268_099|Had I heard ?
p268_100|What happened in that game ?
p268_101|Are you going to win ?
p268_102|You should try to have a laugh.
p268_103|There can be no compromise on welfare.
p268_104|He will be kept informed.
p268_105|Maybe this battle has been.
p268_106|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p268_107|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p268_108|Wilson made his remarks on Tuesday.
p268_109|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p268_110|Instead, another depression came in.
p268_111|Even the one she loved.
p268_112|We have thought about doing lots of things.
p268_113|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p268_114|Well, he is an artist.
p268_115|Everything else is a bonus.
p268_116|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p268_117|Those people must be accountable.
p268_118|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
p268_119|They would be supported by visiting specialists.
p268_120|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p268_121|Or so the story goes.
p268_122|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p268_123|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
p268_124|We shall rely on human beings.
p268_125|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
p268_126|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p268_127|The Breadwinner came home from Africa.
p268_128|Their season has been consigned to history.
p268_129|It wasn't possible to relax.
p268_130|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p268_131|But then they scored their fourth.
p268_132|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p268_133|Monty is great in his own backyard.
p268_134|Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
p268_135|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p268_137|All the employees are redundant.
p268_138|Absences should be carefully monitored.
p268_139|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p268_140|The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
p268_141|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
p268_142|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p268_143|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p268_144|He was forced to quit.
p268_145|What do we want to do that for ?
p268_146|Does the name matter ?
p268_147|how do you get it back ?
p268_148|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
p268_149|Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
p268_150|I was given no instructions by no-one.
p268_151|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p268_152|We're not taking any risks.
p268_153|It's very dangerous for markets.
p268_154|That's what happened against Ayr.
p268_155|Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
p268_156|The following are the principal provisions.
p268_157|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p268_158|Before the game we went for a pint.
p268_160|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p268_161|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p268_162|The milk industry is in turmoil.
p268_163|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p268_164|And so the cycle continues.
p268_165|But the relief was short-lived.
p268_166|They exist in name alone.
p268_167|YOU cannot blame the turnout.
p268_168|We have reacted well to each other.
p268_169|There were no plans for a rights issue.
p268_170|I can see it now.
p268_171|What was the matter for concern ?
p268_172|Do I think about them often ?
p268_173|Is it in the right place ?
p268_174|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p268_175|There's still plenty time left.
p268_176|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p268_177|The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
p268_178|We are happy with the referee.
p268_179|Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
p268_180|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p268_181|Pressure of work is no excuse.
p268_182|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p268_183|The hearing was due to continue today.
p268_184|His job was not advertised.
p268_185|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
p268_186|That was just one night.
p268_187|My father died in childbirth.
p268_188|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p268_189|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p268_190|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
p268_191|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
p268_192|This is a frightening development.
p268_193|In addition, margins have been maintained.
p268_194|Lee Westwood has other ideas.
p268_195|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p268_196|Everyone around the club was supportive.
p268_197|You've got to be vigilant.
p268_198|They have inherited the human rights abusers.
p268_199|This Patton will also return.
p268_200|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p268_201|You are a gambling man.
p268_202|It is all to do with the coaching.
p268_203|There was a fine line to tread.
p268_204|The refund is fully justified.
p268_205|McCarthy said it would look at other means of tackling market abuse.
p268_206|We believe a third party was involved.
p268_207|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p268_208|It would make a lot of sense.
p268_209|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p268_210|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p268_211|Bottling is now the core business.
p268_212|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p268_213|I enjoy the creative process.
p268_214|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p268_215|The whole thing was just unreal.
p268_216|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p268_217|However, this concern appears to be misguided.
p268_218|That group reported just before Christmas.
p268_219|We had to add value.
p268_220|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p268_221|My players have no idea about football.
p268_222|Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
p268_223|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p268_224|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p268_225|So I got a blood test.
p268_226|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
p268_227|He wants to be competing for titles and medals.
p268_228|There's always the next century.
p268_229|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
p268_230|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
p268_231|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
p268_232|Years ago it was really quite simple.
p268_233|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p268_234|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
p268_235|They've got some extremely good players.
p268_236|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p268_237|And they removed a Borderer.
p268_238|Does that put pressure on us ?
p268_239|Did it work ?
p268_240|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p268_241|It would seem a natural progression.
p268_242|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p268_243|We will turn the corner.
p268_244|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p268_245|There was no basis for their arrest.
p268_246|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p268_247|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
p268_248|This is absolutely not true.
p268_249|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p268_250|They should stop the bombing.
p268_251|These days are long gone.
p268_252|I've come here for the jersey.
p268_253|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p268_254|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p268_255|Their extinction is not inevitable.
p268_256|It's never great to finish second.
p268_257|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
p268_258|Allen is strong in every shape and form.
p268_259|Her political persuasion is no secret.
p268_260|We have a budget in March.
p268_261|The Dutchman was pleased with the result.
p268_262|You had to go and see him.
p268_263|The shoppers knew it before City investors did.
p268_264|The planning appears to have paid off.
p268_265|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p268_266|We believe in the medium term.
p268_267|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
p268_268|They were never seen again by friends or relatives.
p268_269|They could not match it.
p268_270|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p268_271|A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
p268_272|I came up through the ranks.
p268_273|A warning may be sufficient to reform behaviour.
p268_274|Luckily, our patient was stable.
p268_275|They made such decisions in London.
p268_276|Clearly, they had other problems.
p268_277|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p268_278|The happiness was slightly misplaced.
p268_279|Phase one was a shambles.
p268_280|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p268_282|A winter of discontent awaits.
p268_283|But no party would win overall control of Scotland.
p268_284|Injuries have taken their toll.
p268_285|Says the Duke of York.
p268_286|How independent is that ?
p268_287|What form did that take ?
p268_288|Are they free ?
p268_289|What are they for ?
p268_290|Is there a waiting list ?
p268_291|When she went off it was quite amazing.
p268_292|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p268_293|The Royal Highland was no exception.
p268_294|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p268_295|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
p268_296|They need to be involved.
p268_297|We've had great things in the past.
p268_298|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p268_299|It has been recorded twice.
p268_300|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p268_301|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p268_302|This youngster is so exciting!
p268_303|I'm interested in interesting work.
p268_304|They will probably come back.
p268_305|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p268_306|It caused a lot of upset.
p268_307|I saw them last week.
p268_308|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p268_309|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p268_310|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p268_311|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p268_312|Everyone can have their opinion.
p268_313|I was inspired by two things.
p268_314|It was a lovely sunset.
p268_315|Movie stars are public property.
p268_316|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p268_317|Life has changed for rugby players in just three years.
p268_318|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p268_319|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p268_320|And we have the experience.
p268_321|It gave me something to focus on.
p268_322|The result is utterly compelling.
p268_323|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p268_324|It was his own decision.
p268_325|You are a great player.
p268_326|I won't make an official complaint.
p268_327|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
p268_328|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
p268_329|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p268_330|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p268_331|We have an election in eight days.
p268_332|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p268_333|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p268_334|Walker plans to return indoors.
p268_335|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p268_336|The only problem was the greens.
p268_337|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p268_338|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
p268_339|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p268_340|Twaddle is a case in point.
p268_341|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p268_342|Plans were made to expand.
p268_343|My daughter is an adult.
p268_344|Does it matter ?
p268_345|How do you take them away ?
p268_346|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p268_347|After the match, do you ?
p268_348|Have I really come to this ?
p268_349|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
p268_350|I am considered a teenager.
p268_351|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p268_352|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p268_353|Instead, he missed the lot.
p268_354|Laura is an investment banker.
p268_355|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
p268_356|The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October.
p268_357|William Hague delighted his party.
p268_358|We played them off the pitch.
p268_359|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p268_360|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
p268_361|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
p268_362|The statement contained no surprises.
p268_363|The performance continues to improve.
p268_364|This would include the GM food industry.
p268_365|There was an element of frustration.
p268_366|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
p268_367|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p268_368|Weather should not be a factor.
p268_369|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p268_370|He ended up a headmaster.
p268_371|He looked at me before replying.
p268_372|I have little time for analysts.
p268_373|I have huge respect for him as a journalist.
p268_374|That remains the unanswered question.
p268_375|He added, We are not prepared for war.
p268_376|My wife and family are the support system.
p268_377|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p268_378|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p268_379|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p268_380|Those overseas offices were great.
p268_381|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p268_382|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
p268_383|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p268_384|Labour will almost certainly remain in control.
p268_385|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p268_386|We were beaten by the better team.
p268_387|I have received no explanation.
p268_388|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
p268_389|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p268_390|And it had two seats.
p268_391|This is a load of nonsense.
p269_001|Please call Stella.
p269_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p269_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p269_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p269_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p269_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p269_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p269_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p269_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p269_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p269_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p269_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p269_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p269_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p269_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p269_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p269_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p269_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p269_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p269_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p269_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
p269_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of the number of bows.
p269_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p269_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p269_025|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p269_026|But it failed.
p269_027|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p269_028|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p269_029|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p269_030|I have a theory.
p269_031|Is this accurate?
p269_032|Because we do not need it.
p269_033|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p269_034|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p269_035|Help is needed.
p269_036|A web site is planned for November.
p269_037|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p269_038|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p269_039|That's no bad thing.
p269_040|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p269_041|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p269_042|I was scared.
p269_043|It was ugly.
p269_044|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p269_045|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p269_046|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p269_047|Who can say?
p269_048|He had no enemies.
p269_049|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p269_050|I was inspired by two things.
p269_051|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p269_052|It's very odd.
p269_053|We have not given up hope.
p269_054|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p269_055|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
p269_056|We are a grandmother.
p269_057|None has ever been found.
p269_058|You do not change overnight.
p269_059|Art is extra.
p269_060|They're appalled by that.
p269_061|There was a battle there.
p269_062|Scotland had great assets.
p269_063|It's that kind of place.
p269_064|They are real.
p269_065|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p269_066|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p269_067|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p269_068|You need a trademark.
p269_069|Painful, but only because it's true.
p269_070|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p269_071|It's a winner.
p269_072|There could be a way back.
p269_073|I was as strong as a horse.
p269_074|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p269_075|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p269_076|It is a job creation scheme.
p269_077|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p269_078|He is now resident in England.
p269_079|Even the one she loved.
p269_080|People must remain vigilant.
p269_081|This is the way things should be handled.
p269_082|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p269_083|I'd like to continue that record.
p269_084|That is bound to happen.
p269_085|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p269_086|All options are open.
p269_087|Someone who cares
p269_088|By then, he was walking on water.
p269_089|You will be.
p269_090|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p269_091|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p269_092|The name on the passport and other details have not been disclosed.
p269_093|Today I couldn't run on it.
p269_094|They've got to account for it.
p269_096|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p269_097|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p269_098|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p269_099|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p269_100|May not have been at fault?
p269_101|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p269_102|Oil embargo endorsed.
p269_103|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p269_104|No date has been set for the appeal.
p269_105|It's not perfect.
p269_106|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p269_107|He pleaded for caution.
p269_108|It was quite rigorous.
p269_109|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p269_110|I can't even get into the A team.
p269_111|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p269_112|It was the eighties.
p269_113|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p269_114|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p269_115|Maybe this battle has been.
p269_116|My office is bare.
p269_117|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p269_118|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p269_119|It was a delight on every level.
p269_121|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p269_122|She has been shot.
p269_123|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p269_124|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p269_125|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p269_126|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p269_127|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p269_128|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p269_129|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p269_130|So the European elections are extremely important.
p269_131|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p269_132|Who will attend?
p269_133|Twaddle is a case in point.
p269_134|We had a reunion last week.
p269_135|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p269_136|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p269_137|It's the big omission.
p269_138|If not, a deal could take many months.
p269_139|What will happen then?
p269_140|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p269_141|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p269_142|It's a question of fashion.
p269_143|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p269_144|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p269_145|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p269_146|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p269_147|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p269_148|He is severe.
p269_149|We just had a go.
p269_150|She died at her home.
p269_151|We have seen a copy of the report.
p269_152|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p269_153|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p269_154|It's like a football team.
p269_155|It would be a last resort.
p269_156|That group reported just before Christmas.
p269_157|He will emerge as a world leader.
p269_158|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p269_159|I was so nervous.
p269_160|We want to see the maximum of change.
p269_161|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p269_162|His death was a tragic accident.
p269_163|This latter point is hugely important.
p269_164|It is so unfair.
p269_165|It is an attitude of mind.
p269_166|I've put my own money into this project.
p269_167|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p269_168|I am now unemployed.
p269_169|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p269_170|We have to move forward.
p269_171|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p269_172|I lost my head.
p269_173|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p269_174|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p269_175|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p269_176|They thought they had found a home.
p269_177|His team management was protective.
p269_179|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p269_180|It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
p269_181|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p269_182|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p269_183|Everyone can be bought.
p269_184|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p269_185|They know no other way.
p269_186|It's an idea.
p269_187|They will run a mile.
p269_188|Four policemen were wounded.
p269_189|We did everything by the book.
p269_190|Does this matter?
p269_191|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p269_193|It had been in place since last July.
p269_194|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p269_195|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p269_196|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p269_197|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p269_198|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p269_199|The conference is the first test.
p269_200|We played them off the pitch.
p269_201|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p269_202|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p269_203|It was good fun.
p269_204|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p269_205|It's all about money, money, money.
p269_206|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p269_207|I had been at the Evening Standard for two years.
p269_208|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p269_209|But I am a worried man.
p269_210|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p269_211|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p269_212|Feel the heat?
p269_213|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p269_214|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p269_215|I began to pray.
p269_216|I am delighted for Simon.
p269_217|It had all been arranged.
p269_218|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p269_219|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p269_220|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p269_221|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p269_222|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p269_223|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p269_224|Who was on the panel?
p269_225|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p269_226|It's so special.
p269_227|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p269_228|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p269_229|I have spoken to the skipper.
p269_230|I'd never seen a play about me.
p269_231|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p269_232|My neighbours are horrified.
p269_233|But she was.
p269_234|It's like a basketball.
p269_235|And thought we would get away with it.
p269_236|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p269_237|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p269_238|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p269_239|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p269_240|It's quite nice.
p269_241|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p269_242|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p269_243|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p269_244|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p269_245|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p269_246|I know I'm in a very special position.
p269_247|You can feel at home in China.
p269_248|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
p269_249|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p269_250|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p269_251|I was shocked.
p269_252|I should think so, too.
p269_253|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p269_254|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p269_255|I can't get a job.
p269_256|It is nearly there.
p269_257|Special measures were needed.
p269_258|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p269_259|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p269_260|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p269_261|Kirkwood was arrested.
p269_263|I am very angry.
p269_264|It is also very valuable.
p269_265|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p269_266|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p269_267|The warning is timely.
p269_268|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p269_269|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p269_270|They are never here.
p269_271|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p269_272|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p269_273|It left me with a sadness.
p269_274|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p269_275|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p269_276|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p269_277|They wanted the club to make money.
p269_278|It's a way of life.
p269_279|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p269_280|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p269_281|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p269_282|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p269_283|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p269_284|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p269_285|It happens from time to time.
p269_286|If not, he should go home.
p269_287|They were too hard.
p269_288|I saw it at a ruck.
p269_289|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p269_290|You've got to have both sides.
p269_291|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p269_292|It was a virus.
p269_293|Who will perform?
p269_294|It's like a high school play.
p269_295|This is a national crisis.
p269_296|I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
p269_297|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p269_298|Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
p269_299|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p269_300|It changed my life.
p269_301|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p269_302|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p269_303|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p269_304|A new school will be built.
p269_305|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p269_306|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p269_307|I was the sheep.
p269_308|Graeme was prepared.
p269_309|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p269_310|But it's a subtle process.
p269_311|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p269_312|There is no openness.
p269_313|They are wrong.
p269_314|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p269_315|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p269_316|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p269_317|It's just not funny!
p269_318|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p269_319|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p269_320|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p269_321|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p269_322|I did not name it.
p269_323|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p269_324|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p269_325|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
p269_326|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p269_327|I was rubbish.
p269_328|We are a peaceful people.
p269_329|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p269_330|Kids are terrible.
p269_331|Henman has been warned.
p269_332|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p269_333|The problems began a long time ago.
p269_334|Referees are easy targets.
p269_335|They had a confession.
p269_336|In the old days, it was easy.
p269_337|However, the groups denied the claims.
p269_338|I came into this world with nothing.
p269_339|That's the law of the land.
p269_340|There was no time scale.
p269_341|It is a strong case.
p269_342|Is there a new way forward?
p269_343|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p269_344|The boat was fantastic.
p269_345|I'd like to take the plunge.
p269_346|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p269_347|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p269_348|It's been hard.
p269_349|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p269_350|It is a sign of hope.
p269_352|It has moved on in the last week.
p269_353|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p269_354|You feel the pride.
p269_355|The train was on time.
p269_356|It was so new, so exciting.
p269_357|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p269_358|A great deal has been achieved.
p269_359|It was forced to divert.
p269_360|It should be scrapped.
p269_361|It is long gone.
p269_362|I HAVE a dream.
p269_363|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p269_364|As, indeed, they would be.
p269_365|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p269_366|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p269_367|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p269_368|We will be homeless.
p269_369|I expected these kind of questions.
p269_370|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p269_371|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p269_372|It's a true story.
p269_373|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p269_374|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p269_375|The play is based on a real-life event.
p269_376|He could face a jail sentence.
p269_377|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p269_378|They have not done so this season so far.
p269_379|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p269_380|They play together perfectly.
p269_381|It is a large number.
p269_382|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
p270_001|Please call Stella.
p270_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p270_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p270_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p270_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p270_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p270_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p270_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p270_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p270_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p270_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p270_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p270_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p270_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p270_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p270_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p270_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p270_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p270_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p270_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p270_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p270_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p270_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p270_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p270_025|He was afraid to stay in hospital in Kosovo.
p270_026|They will not be allowed to succeed.
p270_027|Smoking is also very important.
p270_028|Allan Johnston was not match fit.
p270_029|It was as if I had been stabbed.
p270_030|He has the courage of the unaware.
p270_031|Drugs are a serious problem.
p270_032|We have to find a way to put that right.
p270_033|That is the face of fear.
p270_034|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p270_035|Costs have got to be controlled.
p270_036|He really is a lovely man.
p270_037|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p270_038|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p270_039|This represents a tough game for us.
p270_040|The boy is no longer with us.
p270_041|Among them are many criminals.
p270_042|Merger would be entirely logical.
p270_043|Must be prepared to use it.
p270_044|Not if you know the person.
p270_045|That was the theory, anyway.
p270_046|I had come back from London.
p270_047|I had trouble with the producers.
p270_048|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p270_049|My fitness was very poor.
p270_050|He also presented You Bet!
p270_051|What do they want us to do ?
p270_052|Is it worth it ?
p270_053|Does it matter ?
p270_054|How do you take them away ?
p270_055|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p270_056|After the match, do you ?
p270_057|Because we do not need it.
p270_058|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
p270_059|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p270_060|We have not given up hope.
p270_061|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p270_062|We have made a commitment to those people.
p270_063|Have a look at our accounts.
p270_064|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p270_065|Final proposals will be published in February.
p270_066|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p270_067|It wasn't possible to relax.
p270_068|Then followed a bout of flu.
p270_069|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p270_070|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p270_071|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p270_072|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p270_073|She declined to give the reasons for the decision.
p270_074|It is not in my nature.
p270_075|My immune system had been depleted.
p270_076|It was a unanimous decision.
p270_077|It makes for an interesting conference.
p270_078|I've had it for the exams.
p270_079|I first met him last summer.
p270_080|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p270_081|They lived for their children.
p270_082|Potions said he would drive.
p270_083|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p270_084|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p270_085|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p270_086|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p270_087|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p270_088|The peace process will be buried!
p270_089|They must be on commission.
p270_090|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p270_091|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p270_092|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p270_093|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p270_094|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p270_095|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
p270_096|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p270_097|But the battle has only just begun.
p270_098|In the end we made too many errors.
p270_099|That time is not now, however.
p270_100|The following are the principal provisions.
p270_101|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p270_102|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p270_103|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p270_104|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
p270_105|I understand the medical concerns.
p270_106|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p270_107|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p270_108|We deserve a significant rise.
p270_109|I would be prepared to go anywhere.
p270_110|You had better believe it.
p270_111|The website has changed the company.
p270_112|This is a step backwards.
p270_113|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
p270_114|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
p270_115|Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
p270_116|The problem was a social problem.
p270_117|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p270_118|You were made to feel so welcome.
p270_119|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p270_120|You can spend money on housing.
p270_121|It's not a quick fix.
p270_122|That admission is not surprising.
p270_123|Those people must be accountable.
p270_124|I've never seen a game like it.
p270_125|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p270_126|But we could only help a handful of people.
p270_127|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p270_128|Becoming a father was wonderful.
p270_129|I was on a roll.
p270_130|Are they free ?
p270_131|What are they for ?
p270_132|Is there a waiting list ?
p270_133|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p270_134|So what happens next ?
p270_135|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p270_136|But beyond a fairly minimal level it has little impact.
p270_137|The first half was depressing.
p270_138|They made such decisions in London.
p270_139|Italy was just behind the US.
p270_140|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p270_141|I feel very grateful with everything.
p270_142|There was an element of frustration.
p270_143|Before it was an ordeal.
p270_144|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
p270_145|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p270_146|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p270_147|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p270_148|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p270_149|We will provide immediate access.
p270_150|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p270_151|It is not disputed that the driver was at fault.
p270_152|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p270_153|They have not been named.
p270_154|The transaction is not feasible.
p270_155|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p270_156|We will turn the corner.
p270_157|My Dad is a hero.
p270_158|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p270_159|Is our children learning ?
p270_160|How independent is that ?
p270_161|What form did that take ?
p270_162|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
p270_163|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
p270_164|The woman was his wife.
p270_165|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p270_166|Scotland came very close in the second Test.
p270_167|We did what we had to do.
p270_168|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p270_169|She returned to the theatre.
p270_170|It's nice to be involved.
p270_171|That would open the gates of hell.
p270_172|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p270_173|Nobody did in those days.
p270_174|There is no signature on this document.
p270_175|I would be very keen on a move to Italy.
p270_176|They could not match it.
p270_177|His team management was protective.
p270_178|The jury is still out.
p270_179|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p270_180|City sentiment is in his favour.
p270_181|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p270_182|I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
p270_183|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p270_184|For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
p270_185|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p270_186|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p270_187|They receive a high profile in the media.
p270_188|That's not fair to the supporters.
p270_189|They bought the property four years ago.
p270_190|They need to look after themselves.
p270_191|Miller was every bit as happy.
p270_192|You know the sort of thing.
p270_193|They were seriously after him.
p270_194|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p270_195|We represent a wide range of society.
p270_196|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p270_197|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p270_198|I know every village and island on the west coast.
p270_199|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p270_200|He should emerge as the winner.
p270_201|In France, the reverse is true.
p270_202|I came home by ambulance.
p270_203|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p270_204|They have the cash and the fire power.
p270_205|We believe a third party was involved.
p270_206|The early physical reports were clear.
p270_207|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p270_208|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p270_209|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p270_210|This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.
p270_211|I am very realistic about these things.
p270_212|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
p270_213|They are looking at a flotation.
p270_214|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p270_215|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p270_216|It would appear to be a good time to invest.
p270_217|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p270_218|From there, they can go anywhere.
p270_219|There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
p270_220|It had all been arranged.
p270_221|What was the matter for concern ?
p270_222|Do I think about them often ?
p270_223|Is it in the right place ?
p270_224|Did he trip ?
p270_225|Does that put pressure on us ?
p270_226|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p270_227|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p270_228|They are difficult awards to decide.
p270_229|I am considered a teenager.
p270_230|There's a chance they might come down.
p270_231|Yet the evidence is plain to see.
p270_232|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
p270_233|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p270_234|People should make their own decisions.
p270_235|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p270_236|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p270_237|That was a real challenge.
p270_238|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p270_239|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p270_240|We were a shambles at the back.
p270_241|The scientific debate is dead.
p270_242|They are the innocent victims.
p270_243|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p270_244|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p270_245|This would include the GM food industry.
p270_246|And he goes with it.
p270_247|It had so much to do with output.
p270_248|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p270_249|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p270_250|The irony was not lost.
p270_251|I might get an injury very easily.
p270_252|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p270_253|Everything depends on the weather.
p270_254|This is a historic occasion.
p270_255|This championship is different from the other majors.
p270_256|Labour was too busy to respond.
p270_257|I was just getting over the time difference.
p270_258|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p270_259|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p270_260|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
p270_261|You're not getting any goodwill.
p270_262|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p270_263|No production contract is yet in sight.
p270_264|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p270_265|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p270_266|We accept the new rules.
p270_267|It is probably in the culture.
p270_268|He took over our lives.
p270_269|I'd never run for them.
p270_270|how do you get it back ?
p270_271|What are you not good at ?
p270_272|I think, therefore I am ?
p270_273|Who was she ?
p270_274|Or was it ?
p270_275|And they were being paid ?
p270_276|These figures are truly terrible.
p270_277|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p270_278|He could see no other bidder.
p270_279|There's not much money in cycling.
p270_280|None of this work is guaranteed.
p270_281|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p270_282|Any error is severely punished.
p270_283|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p270_284|I understand the security issue.
p270_285|It left me with a sadness.
p270_286|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p270_287|The target is to break even by Christmas.
p270_288|It was never a free kick.
p270_289|The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
p270_290|It involved the same people.
p270_291|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p270_292|You have to expect this type of thing.
p270_293|There's always the next century.
p270_294|It's hard to see it.
p270_295|The partnership was set up during the summer.

p270_297|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p270_298|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p270_299|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p270_300|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p270_301|The rescue package is public money.
p270_302|He was overwhelmed by the response.
p270_303|The effect was almost magical.
p270_304|It would be great to win the title again.
p270_305|It could well be military.
p270_306|Selection is not in my hands at all.
p270_307|His day had started much like any other Sunday.
p270_308|The songs are just so good.
p270_309|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p270_310|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p270_311|The world record is suspicious.
p270_312|There was no hint of scandal.
p270_313|I was brought up in a mining background.
p270_314|Job losses were also announced.
p270_315|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p270_316|It is a road of death.
p270_317|The pound has also suffered.
p270_318|He has left the company.
p270_319|What happened in that game ?
p270_320|Are you going to win ?
p270_321|Was it the wife ?
p270_322|Why change it ?
p270_323|What do we want to do that for ?
p270_324|Does the name matter ?
p270_325|People can really get themselves in a mess.
p270_326|Survival is not an option.
p270_327|There will be good prospects ahead.
p270_328|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
p270_329|It is a court case.
p270_330|This isn't the end of story.
p270_331|It will set the tone.
p270_332|He will go a long way.
p270_333|It is far too early.
p270_334|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p270_335|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p270_336|Age is not like other forms of discrimination.
p270_337|The next week is crucial.
p270_338|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p270_339|My body is clearly capable.
p270_340|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p270_341|There was some merit in that.
p270_342|They were impressive against France.
p270_343|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p270_344|So, did she meet him ?
p270_345|So what is the campaign about ?
p270_346|And does it ?
p270_347|Are you from the rugby ?
p270_348|He declined to comment on possible disposals.
p270_349|Nobody said it was required.
p270_350|This statement has never been withdrawn.
p270_351|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p270_352|Whether this return was too soon.
p270_353|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p270_354|There is a good example in this city.
p270_355|It's wonderful to have won.
p270_356|He was at school in Devon.
p270_357|This decision is a farce.
p270_358|My view has now completely changed.
p270_359|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p270_360|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p270_361|We have very limited capacity.
p270_362|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p270_363|An alternative must be offered.
p270_364|The value of the merger is still there.
p270_365|Nobody else was with me.
p270_366|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
p270_367|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p270_368|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p270_369|He was then replaced by Ross.
p270_370|But BA said the prediction was premature.
p270_371|You need a licence to run a pub.
p270_372|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
p270_373|I came here this week to work.
p270_374|They knew that I wanted to do something.
p270_375|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p270_376|He must have seen the movie.
p270_377|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p270_378|She said they would appeal.
p270_379|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p270_380|How are you, sir ?
p270_381|So is that it, then ?
p270_382|What do we do ?
p270_383|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p270_384|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p270_385|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p270_386|She is obviously very disappointed.
p270_387|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p270_388|Last season was very hard for me.
p270_389|The parties include the Scottish Executive.
p270_390|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p270_391|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p270_392|I always knew she was funny.
p270_393|Glasgow University declined to comment.
p270_394|It runs until the beginning of June.
p270_395|It sounds like a wish list.
p270_396|They have not got anyone.
p270_397|It has happened for generations.
p270_398|There was a substantial explosion.
p270_399|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p270_400|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p270_401|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p270_402|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p270_403|There's still no-one like him.
p270_404|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p270_405|Ferguson must take the blame.
p270_406|It's too close to call.
p270_407|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p270_408|Of course, it is nonsense.
p270_409|Colour was at the core of his life.
p270_410|We must improve our relations with government.
p270_411|That is the ultimate revenge.
p270_412|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p270_413|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p270_414|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p270_415|Shelter also supports the reform.
p270_416|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p270_417|That was a touch of class.
p270_418|People will see this over time.
p270_419|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p270_420|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p270_421|My aim is a top six finish.
p270_422|Such an attack is bizarre.
p270_423|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p270_424|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p270_425|It was a breathtaking moment.
p270_426|It needs to be volatile.
p270_427|The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.
p270_428|The woman is basically off her head.
p270_429|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p270_430|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
p270_431|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p270_432|In fact, the reasons are simple.
p270_433|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p270_434|The British government does not want to know.
p270_435|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p270_436|I didn't get to keep it.
p270_437|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
p270_438|It would be very dangerous.
p270_439|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p270_440|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
p270_441|It is not over by any means.
p270_442|It deserved to be a winner.
p271_001|Please call Stella.
p271_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p271_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p271_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p271_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p271_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p271_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p271_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p271_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p271_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p271_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p271_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p271_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p271_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p271_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p271_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p271_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p271_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p271_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p271_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p271_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p271_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p271_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p271_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p271_025|She looked so young.
p271_026|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p271_027|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p271_028|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p271_029|They have no history.
p271_030|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p271_031|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p271_032|I'd just like to play.
p271_033|This is the window.
p271_034|I feel I did not have enough time.
p271_035|We speak about the performance.
p271_036|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p271_037|It was clear.
p271_038|Indeed, he does.
p271_039|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p271_040|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p271_041|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p271_042|We will push.
p271_043|I hate the word.
p271_044|They said she was stable.
p271_045|Among them are many criminals.
p271_046|Is a drug dealer?
p271_047|There is no reason at all.
p271_048|He is too weak to move.
p271_049|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p271_050|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p271_051|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p271_052|Here's a clue.
p271_053|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p271_054|I guess I was lucky, though.
p271_055|I was inspired by two things.
p271_056|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p271_057|I love the Dome.
p271_058|It's so awful.
p271_059|It is unique.
p271_060|I expect a rapid response.
p271_061|That's the truth.
p271_062|Jobs could go.
p271_063|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p271_064|Scotland had great assets.
p271_065|It's that kind of place.
p271_066|They are real.
p271_067|It's good news and long overdue.
p271_068|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p271_069|We should have known.
p271_070|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p271_071|Try to save us.
p271_072|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p271_073|He was at home with his pals.
p271_074|It's all I can do.
p271_075|There could be a way back.
p271_076|Then followed a bout of flu.
p271_077|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p271_078|Neither it is.
p271_079|Is there a new way forward?
p271_080|The party is up for it.
p271_081|Even the one she loved.
p271_082|He is in the queue.
p271_083|He is driven.
p271_084|A play is a set of actions.
p271_085|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p271_086|Someone who cares
p271_087|By then, he was walking on water.
p271_088|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p271_089|They lived for their children.
p271_090|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p271_091|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p271_092|It is a lifeline.
p271_093|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p271_094|He was possessed
p271_095|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p271_096|This one did.
p271_097|Then came the crunch.
p271_098|It is annoying.
p271_099|It is home-grown.
p271_100|They are now divorced.
p271_101|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p271_102|I saw the whole thing.
p271_103|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p271_104|I'm not looking for a breakthrough.
p271_105|It is a love affair.
p271_106|They make a selective perception process.
p271_107|That would be unlawful.
p271_108|We have an election in eight days.
p271_109|He takes the job.
p271_110|She reflects a bit.
p271_111|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
p271_112|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p271_113|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p271_114|I am an actor.
p271_115|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p271_116|It was the eighties.
p271_117|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p271_118|It is so sad.
p271_119|You had better believe it.
p271_120|It's not fair.
p271_121|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p271_122|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p271_123|Who would have?
p271_124|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p271_125|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p271_126|The people will come.
p271_127|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p271_128|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p271_129|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p271_130|We work well together.
p271_131|What will happen then?
p271_132|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p271_133|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p271_134|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p271_135|It was very frightened and dirty.
p271_136|Is that it?
p271_137|My daughter is an adult.
p271_138|He should resign.
p271_139|I was dead.
p271_140|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p271_141|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p271_142|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p271_143|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p271_144|She died at her home.
p271_145|He realises his mistake.
p271_146|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p271_147|I was awful.
p271_148|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p271_149|Note the date.
p271_150|So I got a blood test.
p271_151|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p271_152|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p271_153|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p271_154|The weather forecast isn't good.
p271_155|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p271_156|Work has started.
p271_157|My Dad is a hero.
p271_158|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p271_159|Words were not required.
p271_160|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p271_161|That includes the equipment?
p271_162|These days are long gone.
p271_163|I'd love to be like Peter.
p271_164|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p271_165|It has to be now.
p271_166|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p271_167|As, indeed, they would be.
p271_168|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p271_169|They are not advertised.
p271_170|The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
p271_171|Tell it like it was?
p271_172|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p271_173|We have a budget in March.
p271_174|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p271_175|You had to go and see him.
p271_176|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p271_177|It is really good news.
p271_178|He was a crazy man.
p271_179|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p271_180|One season, they might do well.
p271_181|As we worked.
p271_182|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p271_183|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p271_184|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p271_185|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p271_186|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p271_187|The goals were good.
p271_188|I've been there.
p271_189|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p271_190|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p271_191|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p271_192|What has caused the demise of singing?
p271_193|One was a lawyer.
p271_194|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p271_195|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p271_196|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p271_197|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p271_198|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p271_199|It is a farce.
p271_200|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p271_201|I came home by ambulance.
p271_202|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p271_203|It opened last month.
p271_204|We believe a third party was involved.
p271_205|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p271_206|Tommy is not a problem.
p271_207|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p271_208|He had suffered a heart attack.
p271_209|It was worth a photograph.
p271_210|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p271_211|I don't want to use it.
p271_212|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p271_213|You have a plan?
p271_214|It had all been arranged.
p271_215|I had decided to quit the show.
p271_216|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p271_217|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p271_218|I might come back.
p271_219|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p271_220|That idea is rubbish.
p271_221|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p271_222|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p271_223|We could easily be cut again.
p271_224|He seemed to lose his focus.
p271_225|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p271_226|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p271_227|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p271_228|I will win.
p271_229|I am immensely sad.
p271_230|It's not before time.
p271_231|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p271_232|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p271_233|At the time, he was a living legend.
p271_234|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p271_235|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
p271_236|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p271_237|We were awful.
p271_238|They tried to give her advice.
p271_239|We are so proud.
p271_240|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p271_241|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p271_242|It's quite nice.
p271_243|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p271_244|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p271_245|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p271_246|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p271_247|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p271_248|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p271_249|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p271_250|It is hard won.
p271_251|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p271_252|You can feel at home in China.
p271_253|The scene is about this?
p271_254|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p271_255|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p271_256|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p271_257|The concerns are the same.
p271_258|That could be in place by next year.
p271_259|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p271_260|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p271_261|Chelsea was a great club.
p271_262|Is that a serious question?
p271_263|This is the first step.
p271_264|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p271_265|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p271_266|Blood samples were taken.
p271_267|We shall rely on human beings.
p271_268|This is a question of Islam.
p271_269|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p271_270|You take a risk.
p271_271|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p271_272|He was also married with two children.
p271_273|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p271_274|The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
p271_275|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p271_276|That goes back a long way.
p271_277|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p271_278|She failed in her action.
p271_279|They seem to get away with it.
p271_280|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p271_281|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p271_282|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p271_283|We are a grandmother.
p271_284|He looked very sharp.
p271_285|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p271_286|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p271_287|You feel very helpless.
p271_288|You've got to have both sides.
p271_289|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p271_290|It was a virus.
p271_291|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p271_292|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p271_293|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p271_294|This is a national crisis.
p271_295|We are not going to forget.
p271_296|No Briton has ever won.
p271_297|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p271_298|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p271_299|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p271_300|Nothing is safe.
p271_301|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p271_302|There is no openness.
p271_303|They are wrong.
p271_304|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p271_305|This is a war over our home.
p271_306|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p271_307|The court had a number of empty seats.
p271_308|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p271_309|The plot is minimal.
p271_310|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p271_311|There is no excuse.
p271_312|The letters are going out today.
p271_313|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p271_314|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p271_315|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p271_316|My whole life has changed.
p271_317|We are a peaceful people.
p271_318|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p271_319|Henman has been warned.
p271_320|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p271_321|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p271_322|They had a confession.
p271_323|We are in the end game.
p271_324|It will work.
p271_325|It's too horrible to think.
p271_326|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p271_327|There was no time scale.
p271_328|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p271_329|It is a job creation scheme.
p271_330|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p271_331|Relief was beyond belief.
p271_332|Is that an issue?
p271_333|They should take their mobile phones.
p271_334|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p271_335|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p271_336|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p271_337|Who will do it?
p271_338|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p271_339|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p271_340|I've got no secret.
p271_341|This is a big advantage.
p271_342|went on sale.
p271_343|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p271_344|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p271_345|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p271_346|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p271_347|I got a yellow card.
p271_348|We have big ideas.
p271_349|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p271_350|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p271_351|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p271_352|Until they came to do it.
p271_353|It is not like us.
p271_354|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p271_355|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p271_356|We will be homeless.
p271_357|That would help.
p271_358|My husband was angry.
p271_359|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p271_360|It is a memorial.
p271_361|And he laughs.
p271_362|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p271_363|There was a substantial explosion.
p271_364|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p271_365|Their time has gone.
p271_366|It has only been rumours.
p271_367|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p271_368|The death rates are still as high.
p271_369|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p271_370|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p271_371|It seems a long time ago.
p271_372|There is no signature.
p271_373|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p271_374|It became a national network.
p271_375|I am a wealthy person.
p271_376|The BBC was a disgrace.
p271_377|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p271_378|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p271_379|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p271_380|That's the name of the game, though.
p271_381|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p271_382|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p271_383|Yet the data is compelling.
p271_384|It's a real problem.
p271_385|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p271_386|Who will provide the wine?
p271_387|It is unusual.
p271_388|They deserved the win.
p271_389|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p271_390|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p271_391|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p271_392|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p271_393|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p271_394|But we are a young side.
p271_395|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p271_396|It will take place in July.
p271_397|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p271_398|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p271_399|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p271_400|It is full-scale.
p271_401|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p271_402|He will be judged by his actions.
p271_403|It is an absolute nonsense.
p271_404|They are not left wing.
p271_405|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p271_406|In a way he was.
p271_407|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p271_408|It might be.
p271_409|The weekly average was three hours.
p271_410|He scored a touchdown.
p271_411|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p271_412|He got his degree.
p271_413|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p271_414|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p271_415|But we finished the show.
p271_416|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p271_417|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p271_418|That may be.
p271_419|It is legally binding.
p271_420|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p271_421|The service from the other players was super.
p271_422|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p271_423|Paris is not only young.
p271_424|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p271_425|He is to appeal.
p271_426|It was like someone had died.
p271_427|I'm very grateful.
p271_428|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
p271_429|We have the location, which is assured.
p271_430|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
p271_431|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p271_432|I know the worry over Iraq.
p271_433|Everything has collapsed.
p271_434|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p272_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p272_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p272_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p272_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p272_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p272_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p272_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p272_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p272_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p272_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p272_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p272_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p272_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p272_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p272_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p272_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p272_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p272_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p272_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p272_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p272_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p272_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p272_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p272_025|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p272_026|Is this accurate?
p272_027|They have no history.
p272_028|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p272_029|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p272_030|There's a story, too.
p272_031|This is the window.
p272_032|He was jailed for five years.
p272_033|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p272_034|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p272_035|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p272_036|Was it worth it?
p272_037|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p272_038|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p272_039|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p272_040|They're just different.
p272_041|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p272_042|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p272_043|Indeed, he does.
p272_044|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p272_045|He's just in it for himself.
p272_046|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p272_047|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p272_048|We will push.
p272_049|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p272_050|This represents a tough game for us.
p272_051|It is bizarre.
p272_052|They said she was stable.
p272_053|Is a drug dealer?
p272_054|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p272_055|He is too weak to move.
p272_056|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p272_057|He looks like an Afghan.
p272_058|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p272_059|Here's a clue.
p272_060|It had been in place since last July.
p272_061|Next league matches Celtic.
p272_062|There was no safety net.
p272_063|It is unique.
p272_064|That's the truth.
p272_065|They are ready.
p272_066|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p272_067|I feel I did not have enough time.
p272_068|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p272_069|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p272_070|They are real.
p272_071|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p272_072|That was a gold medal for certain.
p272_073|He was popular.
p272_074|But I've won both ways.
p272_075|There was an e-mail.
p272_076|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p272_077|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p272_078|Painful, but only because it's true.
p272_079|I had my suspicions.
p272_080|He was at home with his pals.
p272_081|It was magic.
p272_082|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p272_083|It is a job creation scheme.
p272_084|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p272_085|Even the one she loved.
p272_086|Today she has been released.
p272_087|He is in the queue.
p272_088|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p272_089|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p272_090|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p272_091|Someone who cares
p272_092|By then, he was walking on water.
p272_093|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p272_094|It is a blow.
p272_095|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p272_096|They lived for their children.
p272_097|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p272_098|Today I couldn't run on it.
p272_099|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p272_100|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p272_101|It was clear.
p272_102|It is annoying.
p272_103|But I was wrong.
p272_104|I love the Dome.
p272_105|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p272_106|Our position remains unchanged.
p272_107|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p272_108|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p272_109|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p272_110|You should be.
p272_111|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p272_112|Two of the team became ill.
p272_113|He takes the job.
p272_114|She reflects a bit.
p272_115|I am just trying to do my job.
p272_116|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p272_117|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p272_118|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p272_119|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p272_120|It is so sad.
p272_121|The mood is upbeat.
p272_122|It is rubbish.
p272_123|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p272_124|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p272_125|Who would have?
p272_126|There were no grounds for his action.
p272_127|I can't even get into the A team.
p272_128|I'm so angry.
p272_129|She really suffered for her art.
p272_130|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p272_131|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p272_132|No production was achieved.
p272_133|The BBC was a disgrace.
p272_134|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
p272_135|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p272_136|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p272_137|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p272_138|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p272_139|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p272_140|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p272_141|I had decided to quit the show.
p272_142|We want to keep the pound.
p272_143|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p272_144|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p272_145|Who would be right?
p272_146|She died at her home.
p272_147|He realises his mistake.
p272_148|The role of the law lords would be retained.
p272_149|It is not just about pay.
p272_150|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p272_151|So I got a blood test.
p272_152|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p272_153|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p272_154|I was so nervous.
p272_155|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p272_156|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p272_157|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p272_158|We are on a four-year mission.
p272_159|They should come clean.
p272_160|My Dad is a hero.
p272_161|He can do no wrong.
p272_162|Well, he should know.
p272_163|It is so unfair.
p272_164|I will tell you.
p272_165|I've put my own money into this project.
p272_166|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p272_167|It is not like us.
p272_168|We've all had the shots.
p272_169|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p272_170|Again, we were lucky.
p272_171|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p272_172|Does that put pressure on us?
p272_173|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p272_174|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p272_175|As we worked.
p272_176|Tony had arrived.
p272_177|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p272_178|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p272_179|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p272_180|They need to look after themselves.
p272_181|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p272_182|What has caused the demise of singing?
p272_183|Our team is just so young.
p272_184|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p272_185|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p272_186|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p272_187|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p272_188|Peace was won.
p272_189|It's a fact.
p272_190|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p272_191|We believe a third party was involved.
p272_192|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p272_193|Tommy is not a problem.
p272_194|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p272_195|But she might be.
p272_196|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p272_197|It was worth a photograph.
p272_198|They make a selective perception process.
p272_199|We have an election in eight days.
p272_200|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p272_201|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p272_202|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p272_203|Twaddle is a case in point.
p272_204|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p272_205|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p272_206|In each case they were a goal down.
p272_207|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p272_208|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p272_209|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p272_210|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p272_211|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p272_212|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p272_213|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p272_214|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p272_215|It's not before time.
p272_216|The report is due out next month.
p272_217|But she was.
p272_218|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p272_219|At the time, he was a living legend.
p272_220|They must do it.
p272_221|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p272_222|However, no further action was taken by police.
p272_223|Until they came to do it.
p272_224|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p272_225|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p272_226|There is no excuse.
p272_227|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p272_228|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p272_229|But it's a subtle process.
p272_230|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p272_231|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p272_232|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p272_233|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p272_234|It is hard won.
p272_235|Our policy is clear.
p272_236|The scene is about this?
p272_237|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p272_238|There wasn't a goal.
p272_239|I should think so, too.
p272_240|There's the mix.
p272_241|The concerns are the same.
p272_242|I can't get a job.
p272_243|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p272_244|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p272_245|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p272_246|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p272_247|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p272_248|Is that a serious question?
p272_249|This is the first step.
p272_250|They must play for each other.
p272_251|Souter will be back.
p272_252|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p272_253|Blood samples were taken.
p272_254|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p272_255|We shall rely on human beings.
p272_256|This is a question of Islam.
p272_257|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p272_258|Immediate action must be taken.
p272_259|It's very nice.
p272_260|He was also married with two children.
p272_261|The system can work.
p272_262|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p272_263|We're in shock.
p272_264|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p272_265|It's a way of life.
p272_266|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p272_267|It was very fast.
p272_268|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p272_269|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p272_270|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p272_271|If not, he should go home.
p272_272|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p272_273|He looked very sharp.
p272_274|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p272_275|All options are open.
p272_276|Dialogue is the key.
p272_277|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p272_278|It was a virus.
p272_279|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p272_280|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p272_281|This is a national crisis.
p272_282|It was good.
p272_283|Who did the recruiting?
p272_284|Bombing slaughter rejected
p272_285|The songs are just so good.
p272_286|The goals will come.
p272_287|There's a pause.
p272_288|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p272_289|I was the sheep.
p272_290|What has altered?
p272_291|I was brought up in a mining background.
p272_292|Nothing is safe.
p272_293|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p272_294|One was a lawyer.
p272_295|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p272_296|They are wrong.
p272_297|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p272_298|The plot is minimal.
p272_299|You are the glory.
p272_300|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p272_301|The letters are going out today.
p272_302|We want to play at the worlds.
p272_303|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
p272_304|My whole life has changed.
p272_305|We are a peaceful people.
p272_306|You may have a short memory.
p272_307|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p272_308|My body is clearly capable.
p272_309|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p272_310|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p272_311|A review is under way.
p272_312|It will work.
p272_313|I came into this world with nothing.
p272_314|It's too horrible to think.
p272_315|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p272_316|Off with their heads.
p272_317|Is there a new way forward?
p272_318|I was invited to work in Germany.
p272_319|Is that an issue?
p272_320|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p272_321|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p272_322|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p272_323|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p272_324|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
p272_325|Well, it won't.
p272_326|These days are long gone.
p272_327|Two people were interviewed.
p272_328|I've got no secret.
p272_329|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p272_330|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p272_331|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p272_332|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p272_333|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p272_334|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p272_335|He loves the big occasions.
p272_336|The performance was excellent.
p272_337|That has been lost.
p272_338|Tell us about it.
p272_339|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p272_340|She said they would appeal.
p272_341|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p272_342|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p272_343|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p272_344|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p272_345|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p272_346|As, indeed, they would be.
p272_347|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p272_348|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p272_349|We will be homeless.
p272_350|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p272_351|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p272_352|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p272_353|There was a substantial explosion.
p272_354|Not so, it seems.
p272_355|He could make it.
p272_356|Four policemen were wounded.
p272_357|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p272_358|It's now down in black and white.
p272_359|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p272_360|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p272_361|They have not done so this season so far.
p272_362|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p272_363|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p272_364|So there, we won.
p272_365|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p272_366|There is no signature.
p272_367|It was a funny game.
p272_368|He was the architect.
p272_369|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p272_370|I've never seen a game like it.
p272_371|I am a wealthy person.
p272_372|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p272_373|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p272_374|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p272_375|Something is wrong.
p272_376|You can cope with it.
p272_377|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p272_378|That's the name of the game, though.
p272_379|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p272_380|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p272_381|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p272_382|At the last I found a bunker.
p272_383|Yet the data is compelling.
p272_384|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p272_385|It's a real problem.
p272_386|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p272_387|I was in the train station overnight.
p272_388|It is unusual.
p272_389|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p272_390|It's like a basketball.
p272_391|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p272_392|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p273_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p273_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p273_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p273_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p273_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p273_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p273_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, and its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p273_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p273_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p273_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p273_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p273_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p273_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p273_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p273_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p273_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p273_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p273_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p273_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p273_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p273_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p273_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p273_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p273_025|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p273_026|It was as if I had been stabbed.
p273_027|Because we do not need it.
p273_028|It is about control of our economy.
p273_029|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p273_030|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
p273_031|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
p273_032|It carries a double message.
p273_033|That is the face of fear.
p273_034|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p273_035|Among them are many criminals.
p273_036|This will save interest charges.
p273_037|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p273_038|He looks like an Afghan.
p273_039|Everything else is a bonus.
p273_040|People want to see me on the screen.
p273_041|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p273_042|I was inspired by two things.
p273_043|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p273_044|My fitness was very poor.
p273_045|We have to look beyond the very short term.
p273_046|The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.
p273_047|I expect a rapid response.
p273_048|I must take a seat.
p273_049|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p273_050|How are you, sir ?
p273_051|So is that it, then ?
p273_052|Do I have a favourite ?
p273_053|What do we do ?
p273_054|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
p273_055|Let's hope that it does.
p273_056|We have to keep our clients.
p273_057|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p273_058|We will pay their bills.
p273_059|It was exactly four months away.
p273_060|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p273_061|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p273_062|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p273_063|The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.
p273_064|I was as strong as a horse.
p273_065|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p273_066|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p273_067|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p273_068|The creditors have lost a lot.
p273_069|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p273_070|Even the one she loved.
p273_071|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p273_072|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p273_073|It makes for an interesting conference.
p273_074|This view was echoed by another Scottish analyst.
p273_075|No progress has been made.
p273_076|He has been a success this year.
p273_077|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p273_078|We have to offer value for money.
p273_079|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p273_080|It's so hard to shift.
p273_081|They lived for their children.
p273_082|Potions said he would drive.
p273_083|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p273_084|He had missed a penalty against the English.
p273_085|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p273_086|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p273_087|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p273_088|It was clear on Thursday.
p273_089|It was a family tragedy.
p273_090|It's not a holiday time for football players.
p273_091|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
p273_092|He was prepared for this.
p273_093|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p273_094|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p273_095|We intend to change the model.
p273_096|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
p273_097|But the battle has only just begun.
p273_098|The following are the principal provisions.
p273_099|Before the game we went for a pint.
p273_100|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p273_101|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
p273_102|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p273_103|We deserve a significant rise.
p273_104|Got to win today, though.
p273_105|The pressure is on them.
p273_106|New Year will be very busy.
p273_107|There's still plenty of time left.
p273_108|I didn't think so either.
p273_109|He thought she was amazing.
p273_110|I came here this week to work.
p273_111|Then again, we could have.
p273_112|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p273_113|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p273_114|We would make a start.
p273_115|His job was not advertised.
p273_116|This is a frightening development.
p273_117|Which can happen any time.
p273_118|That is far too high.
p273_119|My life has changed a lot.
p273_120|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p273_121|That would open the gates of hell.
p273_122|You are a gambling man.
p273_123|It feels like a privilege.
p273_124|That is the ultimate revenge.
p273_125|I am totally devoted to this job.
p273_126|We'll have to think about it.
p273_127|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p273_128|The findings are published in the British Journal of Cancer.
p273_129|I'm so grateful for that.
p273_130|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
p273_131|There's always the next century.
p273_132|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p273_133|The weather forecast isn't good.
p273_134|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p273_135|Behind him was his brother.
p273_136|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p273_137|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p273_138|It would seem a natural progression.
p273_139|It was a terrible combination of factors.
p273_140|Today is not a victory.
p273_141|Why do it otherwise ?
p273_142|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p273_143|So, did she meet him ?
p273_144|So what is the campaign about ?
p273_145|And does it ?
p273_146|Are you from the rugby ?
p273_147|Had I heard ?
p273_148|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p273_149|They should stop the bombing.
p273_150|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p273_151|I'm not going to answer that right now.
p273_152|It's never great to finish second.
p273_153|The long-term trend is certainly moving towards a balance.
p273_154|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p273_155|They could not match it.
p273_156|I always felt they played for me.
p273_157|His team management was protective.
p273_158|One season, they might do well.
p273_159|The jury is still out.
p273_160|Phase one was a shambles.
p273_161|I did not have a bet on myself.
p273_162|It is also very valuable.
p273_163|For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
p273_164|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p273_165|Says the Duke of York.
p273_166|They bought the property four years ago.
p273_167|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
p273_168|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
p273_169|You know the sort of thing.
p273_170|It was a bit like having children.
p273_171|It shows the strength of the roots.
p273_172|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p273_173|This youngster is so exciting!
p273_174|Two years later, she was dead.
p273_175|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p273_176|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p273_177|Everyone can have their opinion.
p273_178|Because he was born in England.
p273_179|I came home by ambulance.
p273_180|What happened in that game ?
p273_181|Are you going to win ?
p273_182|Was it the wife ?
p273_183|Why change it ?
p273_184|What do we want to do that for ?
p273_185|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p273_186|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p273_187|It was a moment of madness.
p273_188|They have the cash and the fire power.
p273_189|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p273_190|The early physical reports were clear.
p273_191|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p273_192|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p273_193|It gave no further details.
p273_194|Little is known about them.
p273_195|I won't make an official complaint.
p273_196|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
p273_197|It was worth a photograph.
p273_198|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p273_199|His injury was completely random.
p273_200|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p273_201|From there, they can go anywhere.
p273_202|I'm just a regular person.
p273_203|It had all been arranged.
p273_204|The statement contained no surprises.
p273_205|His third goal was superb.
p273_206|It will affect their work.
p273_207|I am considered a teenager.
p273_208|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p273_209|There's a chance they might come down.
p273_210|The transaction is not feasible.
p273_211|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p273_212|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p273_213|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p273_214|He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
p273_216|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p273_217|William Hague delighted his party.
p273_218|You could feel the heat.
p273_219|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p273_220|I have spoken to the skipper.
p273_221|That was a problem for me.
p273_222|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
p273_223|They would have to go to the Royal.
p273_224|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p273_225|He is obviously very dangerous.
p273_226|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p273_227|It had so much to do with the output.
p273_228|We have not been approached.
p273_229|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p273_230|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p273_231|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p273_232|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p273_233|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
p273_234|The irony was not lost.
p273_235|He said the move followed a downturn in business travel.
p273_236|My future is in the marathon.
p273_237|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p273_238|We were well worth the win.
p273_239|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p273_240|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p273_241|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p273_242|You can feel at home in China.
p273_243|Does the name matter ?
p273_244|how do you get it back ?
p273_245|What are you not good at ?

p274_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
p274_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
p274_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
p274_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
p274_010|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
p274_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )

p274_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
p274_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
p274_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
p274_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
p274_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
p274_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
p274_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
p274_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
p274_025|I can't play the game for them.)

p274_412|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.)
p274_413|But the foundations have been laid.)
p274_414|That is the ultimate revenge.)

p274_419|The second goal was superb.)
p274_420|Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.)
p274_421|I was pleased with my own game.)
p274_422|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.)
p274_423|This should put downward pressure on inflation.)
p274_424|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.)
p274_425|The projections are very positive for South Africa.)
p274_426|Being captain of this club is fantastic.)
p274_427|Such an attack is bizarre.)
p274_428|It needs to be volatile.)
p274_429|I never had a childhood.)
p274_430|The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.)
p274_431|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.)
p274_432|The trial will open today.)
p274_433|There is another important factor.)
p274_434|This is a limited market.)
p274_435|Its failure is no surprise.)
p274_436|No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.)
p274_437|The Festival is prepared to help.)

p274_439|His message was very simple.)
p274_440|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.)
p274_441|I didn't get to keep it.)
p274_442|Their condition is described as satisfactory.)
p274_443|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)
p274_444|They are interior designers and architects.)
p274_445|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.)
p274_446|It wouldn't matter if he had.)
p274_447|No further details of expansion plans were given.)
p274_448|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.)
p274_449|It is pretty bad news.)
p274_450|We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.)
p275_001|Please call Stella.
p275_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p275_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p275_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p275_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p275_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p275_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p275_009|There is , according to the legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p275_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p275_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p275_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways.
p275_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p275_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p275_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p275_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p275_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p275_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p275_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p275_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p275_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p275_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p275_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p275_025|But it failed.
p275_026|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p275_027|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p275_028|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p275_029|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p275_030|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p275_031|There's a story, too.
p275_032|He was jailed for four years.
p275_033|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p275_034|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p275_035|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p275_036|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p275_037|They're just different.
p275_038|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p275_039|Indeed, he does.
p275_040|Sadly, it can't.
p275_041|Dancing was her life.
p275_042|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p275_043|We will push.
p275_044|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p275_045|This represents a tough game for us.
p275_046|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p275_047|Among them are many criminals.
p275_048|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p275_049|He looks like an Afghan.
p275_050|Here's a clue.
p275_051|I had come back from London.
p275_052|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p275_053|It is unique.
p275_054|That's the truth.
p275_055|There's a danger.
p275_056|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p275_057|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p275_058|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p275_059|This is the first step.
p275_060|It's good news and long overdue.
p275_061|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p275_062|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p275_063|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p275_064|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p275_065|Try to save us.
p275_066|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p275_067|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p275_068|Strathclyde police had appealed for witnesses.
p275_069|He was at home with his pals.
p275_070|It's all I can do.
p275_071|There could be a way back.
p275_072|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p275_073|It works for us.
p275_074|The party is up for it.
p275_075|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p275_076|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p275_077|I will miss him.
p275_078|A review is under way.
p275_079|He had suffered a heart attack.
p275_080|He is driven.
p275_081|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p275_082|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p275_083|They lived for their children.
p275_084|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p275_085|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p275_086|It is a lifeline.
p275_087|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p275_088|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p275_089|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p275_090|But I was wrong.
p275_091|I saw the whole thing.
p275_092|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p275_093|Hartley should know.
p275_094|It is a love affair.
p275_095|May not have been at fault?
p275_096|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p275_097|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p275_098|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p275_099|Oil embargo endorsed.
p275_100|There were no grounds for his action.
p275_101|He takes the job.
p275_102|She reflects a bit.
p275_103|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped him form.
p275_104|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p275_105|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p275_106|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p275_108|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p275_109|It's a shame.
p275_110|It was the eighties.
p275_111|It is a financial matter.
p275_112|It is so sad.
p275_113|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p275_114|The mood is upbeat.
p275_115|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p275_116|It's not fair.
p275_117|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p275_118|It is rubbish.
p275_119|Who would be a referee?
p275_120|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p275_121|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p275_122|Who would have?
p275_123|That's all right then.
p275_124|I wouldn't have wanted any other way.
p275_125|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p275_126|She really suffered for her art.
p275_127|It is not a U-turn.
p275_128|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p275_129|Who will attend?
p275_130|Twaddle is a case in point.
p275_131|The BBC was a disgrace.
p275_132|I am now unemployed.
p275_133|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p275_134|It plans to return to this field.
p275_135|What will happen then?
p275_136|It's not true.
p275_137|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p275_138|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p275_139|It was very frightened and dirty.
p275_140|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p275_141|Is that it?
p275_142|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p275_143|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p275_144|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p275_145|Who would be right?
p275_146|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
p275_147|He realises his mistake.
p275_148|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p275_149|I was awful.
p275_150|We have the location, which is assured.
p275_151|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p275_152|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p275_153|I am just trying to do my job.
p275_154|So I got a blood test.
p275_155|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p275_156|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p275_157|The weather forecast isn't good.
p275_158|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
p275_159|They have not been named.
p275_160|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p275_161|It was by the numbers.
p275_162|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p275_163|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p275_164|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p275_165|Well, he should know.
p275_166|Was this element always there?
p275_167|These days are long gone.
p275_168|I was in the train station overnight.
p275_169|We've all had the shots.
p275_170|Tell it like it was?
p275_171|Seven people were later detained by police.
p275_172|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p275_173|You had to go and see him.
p275_174|In a way he was.
p275_175|One season, they might do well.
p275_176|Is Saddam a threat?
p275_177|As we worked.
p275_178|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p275_179|It is not either national standards or local control.
p275_180|He deserved the win.
p275_181|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p275_182|Tony had arrived.
p275_183|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p275_184|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p275_185|His name was unknown.
p275_186|It's an idea.
p275_187|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p275_188|Four policemen were wounded.
p275_189|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p275_190|What has caused the demise of singing?
p275_191|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p275_192|It is a farce.
p275_193|Peace was won.
p275_194|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p275_195|Yet the data is compelling.
p275_196|I came home by ambulance.
p275_197|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p275_198|I have a cold.
p275_199|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p275_200|Tommy is not a problem.
p275_201|Who will pay for this?
p275_203|But she might be.
p275_205|Some realism was needed about the time, resources and management.
p275_207|I don't want to use it.
p275_208|Feel the heat?
p275_209|He knows a lot.
p275_210|You have a plan?
p275_211|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p275_212|It had all been arranged.
p275_213|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p275_214|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p275_215|He seemed to lose his focus.
p275_216|Work has started.
p275_217|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p275_218|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p275_219|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p275_220|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p275_221|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p275_222|We could easily be cut again.
p275_223|Saturday is gone.
p275_224|It's the Tate.
p275_225|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p275_226|I will win.
p275_227|The report is due out next month.
p275_228|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p275_229|He is in the queue.
p275_230|My wife and family are the support system.
p275_231|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p275_233|The parties have been given until today to respond.
p275_234|Of course I was tempted.
p275_235|We will treat it like a World Cup match.
p275_236|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p275_237|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p275_238|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p275_239|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p275_240|It is hard won.
p275_241|Our policy is clear.
p275_242|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p275_243|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p275_244|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p275_246|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p275_247|It was a hit.
p275_248|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p275_249|I can't get a job.
p275_250|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p275_251|Kirkwood was arrested.
p275_252|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p275_253|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p275_254|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p275_255|Is that a serious question?
p275_256|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p275_257|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p275_258|Souter will be back.
p275_259|Blood samples were taken.
p275_260|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p275_261|It will be done in stages.
p275_262|This is a question of Islam.
p275_263|That review will look at the management across the sector as a whole.
p275_264|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p275_265|It's very nice.
p275_266|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p275_268|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p275_269|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p275_270|It was very fast.
p275_271|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p275_272|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p275_273|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p275_274|It's so awful.
p275_275|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p275_276|We are a grandmother.
p275_277|He looked very sharp.
p275_278|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p275_279|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p275_280|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p275_281|You've got to have both sides.
p275_282|It was a virus.
p275_283|Yet, it worked.
p275_284|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p275_285|It was good.
p275_286|Who did the recruiting?
p275_287|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
p275_288|Bombing slaughter rejected
p275_289|We are not going to forget.
p275_290|I could never be cool.
p275_291|Who can predict?
p275_292|There was a vacuum.
p275_293|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p275_294|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p275_295|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p275_296|She is really magic.
p275_297|One was a lawyer.
p275_298|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p275_299|There were no passengers on board.
p275_300|It could work.
p275_301|This is a war over our home.
p275_302|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p275_303|The court had a number of empty seats.
p275_304|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p275_305|The plot is minimal.
p275_306|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p275_307|There's no evidence he was ever there.
p275_308|You should be.
p275_309|The minister is the engineer.
p275_310|The letters are going out today.
p275_311|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p275_312|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p275_313|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p275_314|We have got to get the points from this one.
p275_315|My whole life has changed.
p275_316|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p275_317|Kids are terrible.
p275_320|We are in the end game.
p275_321|Our message was inclusive.
p275_322|Off with their heads.
p275_323|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p275_324|My view has now completely changed.
p275_325|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p275_326|Is that an issue?
p275_327|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p275_328|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p275_329|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p275_330|It's been hard.
p275_331|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p275_332|Who will do it?
p275_333|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p275_334|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p275_335|He also insisted that no concession had been made to the French.
p275_336|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p275_337|We are the gateway to justice.
p275_338|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p275_339|Yet, for the money, he was not the man of the match.
p275_340|This is a friendly match?
p275_341|I got a yellow card.
p275_342|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p275_343|Tell us about it.
p275_344|There may be reasons for it.
p275_345|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p275_346|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p275_347|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p275_348|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p275_349|She is free.
p275_350|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p275_351|Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p275_352|The pair are very much in love.
p275_353|It is not like us.
p275_354|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p275_355|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p275_356|We will be homeless.
p275_357|That would help.
p275_358|It is a memorial.
p275_359|This is a club on the rise.
p275_360|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p275_361|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p275_362|The death rates are still as high.
p275_363|He's been in a nursing home for two years.
p275_364|It's now down in black and white.
p275_365|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p275_366|They have not done so this season so far.
p275_367|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p275_368|There is no signature.
p275_369|I am a wealthy person.
p275_370|Colour was at the core of his life.
p275_371|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p275_372|It is hard to understand.
p275_373|Something is wrong.
p275_374|You can cope with it.
p275_375|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p275_376|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p275_377|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p275_378|It is the old story.
p275_379|It looked like a river.
p275_380|It's a real problem.
p275_381|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
p275_382|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p275_383|It's like a basketball.
p275_384|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p275_385|It can help.
p275_386|I love the thought of having a crack at the defending title.
p275_387|They are good.
p275_388|I'm glad I came.
p275_389|But we are a young side.
p275_390|That set the tone.
p275_391|It was a breathtaking moment.
p275_392|What happened in the summer?
p275_393|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p275_394|There were no immediate reports of injuries.
p275_395|The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
p275_396|What was the difference between them?
p275_397|He will be judged by his actions.
p275_398|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p275_399|It is an absolute nonsense.
p275_400|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p275_402|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p275_403|It might be.
p275_404|Feel the air, the space.
p275_405|He scored a touchdown.
p275_406|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p275_407|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p275_408|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p276_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p276_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p276_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p276_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p276_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p276_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p276_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p276_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p276_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p276_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p276_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p276_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p276_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p276_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p276_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p276_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p276_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p276_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p276_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p276_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p276_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p276_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p276_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p276_025|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p276_026|How are you, sir ?
p276_027|So is that it, then ?
p276_028|Do I have a favourite ?
p276_029|What do we do ?
p276_030|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
p276_031|Smoking is also very important.
p276_032|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
p276_033|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p276_034|He said police inquiries should not be conducted as political opportunism.
p276_035|There was a rush of water.
p276_036|A fiver and I'll tell.
p276_037|We speak about the performance.
p276_038|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p276_039|Further management changes are planned.
p276_040|I can feel the sound inside.
p276_041|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p276_042|He is married with three children.
p276_043|I might well have done so already.
p276_044|This is slightly negative for inflation.
p276_045|And they had a case.
p276_046|We believe a third party was involved.
p276_047|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p276_048|It carried a double message.
p276_049|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p276_050|But not a penny has been paid.
p276_051|Perhaps it is eyeing a mortgage bank.
p276_052|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p276_053|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p276_054|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p276_055|This represents a tough game for us.
p276_056|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p276_057|Among them are many criminals.
p276_058|And they removed a Borderer.
p276_059|He is too weak to move.
p276_060|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p276_061|They desperately want some stability.
p276_062|Everything is possible in football.
p276_063|We like being the underdogs.
p276_064|He looks like an Afghan.
p276_065|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p276_066|He will need that machine.
p276_067|Then they scored two goals to win.
p276_068|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
p276_069|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p276_070|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p276_071|Let's not be too despondent.
p276_072|There was no safety net.
p276_073|The Government does not go far enough.
p276_074|He phoned the number in the brochure.
p276_075|A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
p276_076|He confirmed that the document was valid.
p276_077|The wingers must have felt the cold.
p276_078|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p276_079|I have made that offer.
p276_080|Why do it otherwise ?
p276_081|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p276_082|So, did she meet him ?
p276_083|So what is the campaign about ?
p276_084|The new deal will now be put to the officers.
p276_085|Carlton also declined to comment last night.
p276_086|But the organisers refused to worry.
p276_087|Webster was brought up in Glasgow.
p276_088|Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
p276_089|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
p276_090|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
p276_091|He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
p276_092|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
p276_093|Funding needs to be long term.
p276_094|We should all be grateful.
p276_095|He's not getting into any games.
p276_096|The coach is a man who is very ambitious.
p276_097|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
p276_098|It was exactly four months away.
p276_099|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
p276_100|THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
p276_101|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p276_102|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p276_103|It wasn't possible to relax.
p276_104|Context is also very important.
p276_105|There could be a way back.
p276_106|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p276_107|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p276_108|People had been talking about a fourth quarter rally.
p276_109|Even the one she loved.
p276_110|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p276_111|He's been active in Arabia.
p276_112|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p276_113|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p276_114|It is sometimes like that.
p276_115|He was unprepared for this fight.
p276_116|I've had it for the exams.
p276_117|Those people must be accountable.
p276_118|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
p276_119|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
p276_120|Choice is a good thing.
p276_121|I am not very pleased.
p276_122|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p276_123|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p276_124|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p276_125|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p276_126|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
p276_127|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p276_128|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p276_129|They lived for their children.
p276_130|Potions said he would drive.
p276_131|Diversions were put in place.
p276_132|The Queen Mother is dead.
p276_133|No one person or small group could be singled out.
p276_134|The excitement could hardly be contained.
p276_135|Margins are also in retreat.
p276_136|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p276_137|He had missed a penalty against the English.
p276_138|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p276_139|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
p276_140|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
p276_141|Cutting ticket prices would certainly help.
p276_142|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p276_143|Absences should be carefully monitored.
p276_144|Four meetings have previously been arranged.
p276_145|The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
p276_146|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
p276_147|We just have to adapt.
p276_148|Are you from the rugby ?
p276_149|What happened in that game ?
p276_150|Are you going to win ?
p276_151|Was it the wife ?
p276_152|Why change it ?
p276_153|And they all have a vote.
p276_154|But they must believe in themselves.
p276_155|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p276_156|Token gestures of tiny tax cuts will not do.
p276_157|We made a world record together.
p276_158|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p276_159|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p276_160|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p276_161|They said so that I would look good in uniform.
p276_162|A good actor doesn't think.
p276_163|That's what happened against Ayr.
p276_164|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
p276_165|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
p276_166|It is a good lifestyle.
p276_167|Before the game we went for a pint.
p276_168|City sentiment is in his favour.
p276_169|His job was not advertised.
p276_170|Nato has left them with no other option.
p276_171|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
p276_172|He was just like a godfather to it.
p276_173|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p276_174|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p276_175|These people are now following their own Unison agenda.
p276_176|It took five months to repair the damage.
p276_177|They exist in name alone.
p276_178|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p276_179|You had better believe it.
p276_180|It was a sobering experience.
p276_181|I can see it now.
p276_182|There's still plenty time left.
p276_183|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p276_184|I've no idea how it works.
p276_185|The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
p276_186|The festivals will be about having fun.
p276_187|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p276_188|She is in good spirits.
p276_189|The changes took effect from June.
p276_190|As if that is an achievement.
p276_191|That will be the sweetness.
p276_192|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
p276_193|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p276_194|There was a fossil on screen.
p276_195|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p276_196|I did not concentrate on my performance.
p276_197|The feedback from them has been fantastic.
p276_198|That admission is not surprising.
p276_199|But he rejected calls for a public register of paedophiles.
p276_200|However, the problem is the timing.
p276_201|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
p276_202|That was just one night.
p276_203|This is a frightening development.
p276_204|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p276_205|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p276_206|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
p276_207|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
p276_208|My father died in childbirth.
p276_209|It is quite a thing to watch.
p276_210|This should begin in October.
p276_211|Twaddle is a case in point.
p276_212|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p276_213|Some promoters made insulting offers.
p276_214|We did what we had to do.
p276_215|The squad is too small.
p276_216|What do we want to do that for ?
p276_217|Does the name matter ?
p276_218|how do you get it back ?
p276_219|What are you not good at ?
p276_220|I think, therefore I am ?
p276_221|You've got to be vigilant.
p276_222|I learned that only yesterday.
p276_223|It's been a humbling year.
p276_224|Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.
p276_225|You are a gambling man.
p276_226|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
p276_227|My daughter is an adult.
p276_228|I would not say that.
p276_229|There was a fine line to tread.
p276_230|The refund is fully justified.
p276_231|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p276_232|I never wanted a legal battle.
p276_233|It would make a lot of sense.
p276_234|It was started almost by accident.
p276_235|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p276_236|Bottling is now the core business.
p276_237|She died at her home.
p276_238|Had this been common practice ?
p276_239|What do they want us to do ?
p276_240|Is it worth it ?
p276_241|Does it matter ?
p276_242|How do you take them away ?
p276_243|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p276_244|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p276_245|We were right to be afraid.
p276_247|That group reported just before Christmas.
p276_248|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p276_249|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p276_250|I COULD tell that Alastair Wilkie was energised.
p276_251|That view has not altered.
p276_252|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p276_253|For business, the benefits will be enormous.
p276_254|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p276_255|Five years later, the deception continued.
p276_256|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
p276_257|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p276_258|I felt we deserved the three points.
p276_259|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
p276_260|They've got some extremely good players.
p276_261|Mr Blair had done well.
p276_262|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p276_263|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p276_264|The family kept away from me.
p276_265|I would have been shot dead in bed.
p276_266|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p276_267|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p276_268|We will turn the corner.
p276_269|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p276_270|My Dad is a hero.
p276_271|And they were being paid ?
p276_272|was everything done to save people ?
p276_273|What was the matter for concern ?
p276_274|Do I think about them often ?
p276_275|Is it in the right place ?
p276_276|Did he trip ?
p276_277|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p276_278|It was a terrible combination of factors.
p276_279|This is absolutely not true.
p276_280|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p276_281|They should stop the bombing.
p276_282|Sunday's game against Celtic is huge.
p276_283|I've come here for the jersey.
p276_284|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p276_285|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p276_286|Their extinction is not inevitable.
p276_287|It's never great to finish second.
p276_288|And, finally, I have good news for the songbirds of Glasgow.
p276_289|It's as eventful as it is momentous.
p276_290|We have a budget in March.
p276_291|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
p276_292|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p276_293|That would open the gates of hell.
p276_294|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
p276_295|We've made a couple of albums.
p276_296|A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
p276_297|We have to keep our clients.
p276_298|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
p276_299|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p276_300|Everything else is a bonus.
p276_301|This championship is different from the other majors.
p276_302|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p276_303|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p276_304|Each case is treated on merit.
p276_305|A winter of discontent awaits.
p276_306|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p276_307|I am astonished at attack.
p276_308|Says the Duke of York.
p276_309|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p276_310|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
p276_311|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p276_312|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
p276_313|We've had great things in the past.
p276_314|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p276_315|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
p276_316|It has been recorded twice.
p276_317|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p276_318|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p276_319|I'm interested in interesting work.
p276_320|We represent a wide range of society.
p276_321|It caused a lot of upset.
p276_322|I saw them last week.
p276_323|Does that put pressure on us ?
p276_324|Did it work ?
p276_325|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p276_326|Is our children learning ?
p276_327|How independent is that ?
p276_328|What form did that take ?
p276_329|Are they free ?
p276_330|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p276_331|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p276_332|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p276_333|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p276_334|I was inspired by two things.
p276_335|The Government has completely lost control of GM crops.
p276_336|MOVIE stars are public property.
p276_337|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p276_338|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
p276_339|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p276_340|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
p276_341|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p276_342|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p276_343|And we have the experience.
p276_344|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p276_345|This included a downward revision in the expected level of dividend.
p276_346|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p276_347|You just have to give yourself a chance.
p276_348|They would be supported by visiting specialists.
p276_349|You have caught a serial killer.
p276_350|I won't make an official complaint.
p276_351|It was worth a photograph.
p276_352|I grew up with that in the amateur game.
p276_353|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p276_354|They make a selective perception process.
p276_355|Employees may be taken on at Livingston.
p276_356|There is no quick fix.
p276_357|What are they for ?
p276_358|Is there a waiting list ?
p276_359|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p276_360|So what happens next ?
p276_361|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p276_362|Walker plans to return indoors.
p276_363|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p276_364|He worked there for six months.
p276_365|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p276_366|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
p276_367|From there, they can go anywhere.
p276_368|I had relied on him.
p276_369|Truth is the child of time.
p276_370|The Reporter appears to have undue influence on the panel.
p276_372|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p276_373|Brown has always protested his innocence.
p276_374|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p276_375|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p276_376|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p276_377|Instead, he missed the lot.
p276_378|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p276_379|Laura is an investment banker.
p276_380|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
p276_381|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p276_382|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p276_383|We played them off the pitch.
p276_384|But the rally was short-lived.
p276_385|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
p276_386|It must be tough to live with.
p276_387|The statement contained no surprises.
p276_388|Six other people were injured.
p276_389|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p276_390|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
p276_391|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p276_392|They would have to go to the Royal.
p276_393|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p276_394|He ended up a headmaster.
p276_395|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
p276_396|He is obviously very dangerous.
p276_397|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
p276_398|That remains the unanswered question.
p276_399|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p276_400|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p276_401|It had so much to do with output.
p276_402|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p276_403|After the match, do you ?
p276_404|Has the conflict started ?
p276_405|Have I really come to this ?
p276_406|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p276_407|Its failure is no surprise.
p276_408|It has to be enforced.
p276_409|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p276_410|Those overseas offices were great.
p276_411|You will have seen the adverts.
p276_412|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
p276_413|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
p276_414|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p276_415|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p276_416|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p276_417|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p276_418|A, The media has been great.
p276_419|Everything has its place and purpose.
p276_420|I have received no explanation.
p276_421|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
p276_422|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p276_423|You didn't need to pay.
p276_424|The might be rolled out.
p276_425|But nothing could be done.
p276_426|They made such decisions in London.
p276_427|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
p276_428|It seems a waste of talents.
p276_429|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p276_430|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p276_431|We have no information on Iraq.
p276_432|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p276_433|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p276_434|The company declined to comment.
p276_435|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p276_436|They make the right decisions.
p276_437|I always savour the company of The Voice.
p276_438|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p276_439|Today has been a good day for Northern Ireland.
p276_440|I got a yellow card.
p276_441|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
p276_442|Not many people like to do that.
p276_443|He now lives in Fenwick in Ayrshire.
p276_444|I might also completely change the routine.
p276_445|We accept the new rules.
p277_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p277_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p277_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p277_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p277_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p277_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p277_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p277_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p277_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p277_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p277_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p277_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p277_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p277_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p277_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p277_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p277_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p277_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p277_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p277_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p277_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p277_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p277_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.
p277_025|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p277_026|Is this accurate?
p277_027|They have no history.
p277_028|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p277_029|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p277_030|There's a story, too.
p277_031|This is the window.
p277_032|He was jailed for five years.
p277_033|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p277_034|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p277_035|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p277_036|Was it worth it?
p277_037|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p277_038|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p277_039|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p277_040|They're just different.
p277_041|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p277_042|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p277_043|Indeed, he does.
p277_044|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p277_045|He's just in it for himself.
p277_046|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p277_047|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p277_048|We will push.
p277_049|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p277_050|This represents a tough game for us.
p277_051|It is bizarre.
p277_052|They said she was stable.
p277_053|Is a drug dealer?
p277_054|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p277_055|He is too weak to move.
p277_056|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p277_057|He looks like an Afghan.
p277_058|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p277_059|Here's a clue.
p277_060|It had been in place since last July.
p277_061|Next league matches Celtic.
p277_062|There was no safety net.
p277_063|It is unique.
p277_064|That's the truth.
p277_065|They are ready.
p277_066|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p277_067|I feel I did not have enough time.
p277_068|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p277_069|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p277_070|They are real.
p277_071|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p277_072|That was a gold medal for certain.
p277_073|He was popular.
p277_074|But I've won both ways.
p277_075|There was an e-mail.
p277_076|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p277_077|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p277_078|Painful, but only because it's true.
p277_079|I had my suspicions.
p277_080|He was at home with his pals.
p277_081|It was magic.
p277_082|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p277_083|It is a job creation scheme.
p277_084|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p277_085|Even the one she loved.
p277_086|Today she has been released.
p277_087|He is in the queue.
p277_088|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p277_089|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p277_090|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p277_091|Someone who cares
p277_092|By then, he was walking on water.
p277_093|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p277_094|It is a blow.
p277_095|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p277_096|They lived for their children.
p277_097|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p277_098|Today I couldn't run on it.
p277_099|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p277_100|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p277_101|It was clear.
p277_102|It is annoying.
p277_103|But I was wrong.
p277_104|I love the Dome.
p277_105|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p277_106|Our position remains unchanged.
p277_107|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p277_108|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p277_109|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p277_110|You should be.
p277_111|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p277_112|Two of the team became ill.
p277_113|He takes the job.
p277_114|She reflects a bit.
p277_115|I am just trying to do my job.
p277_116|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p277_117|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p277_118|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p277_119|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p277_120|It is so sad.
p277_121|The mood is upbeat.
p277_122|It is rubbish.
p277_123|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p277_124|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p277_125|Who would have?
p277_126|There were no grounds for his action.
p277_127|I can't even get into the A team.
p277_128|I'm so angry.
p277_129|She really suffered for her art.
p277_130|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p277_131|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p277_132|No production was achieved.
p277_133|The BBC was a disgrace.
p277_134|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
p277_135|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p277_136|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p277_137|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p277_138|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p277_139|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p277_140|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p277_141|I had decided to quit the show.
p277_142|We want to keep the pound.
p277_143|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p277_144|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p277_145|Who would be right?
p277_146|She died at her home.
p277_147|He realises his mistake.
p277_148|The role of the law lords would be retained.
p277_149|It is not just about pay.
p277_150|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p277_151|So I got a blood test.
p277_152|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p277_153|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p277_154|I was so nervous.
p277_155|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p277_156|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p277_157|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p277_158|We are on a four-year mission.
p277_159|They should come clean.
p277_160|My Dad is a hero.
p277_161|He can do no wrong.
p277_162|Well, he should know.
p277_163|It is so unfair.
p277_164|I will tell you.
p277_165|I've put my own money into this project.
p277_166|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p277_167|It is not like us.
p277_168|We've all had the shots.
p277_169|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p277_170|Again, we were lucky.
p277_171|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p277_172|Does that put pressure on us?
p277_173|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p277_174|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p277_175|As we worked.
p277_176|Tony had arrived.
p277_177|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p277_178|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p277_179|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p277_180|They need to look after themselves.
p277_181|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p277_182|What has caused the demise of singing?
p277_183|Our team is just so young.
p277_184|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p277_185|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p277_186|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p277_187|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p277_188|Peace was won.
p277_189|It's a fact.
p277_190|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p277_191|We believe a third party was involved.
p277_192|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p277_193|Tommy is not a problem.
p277_194|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p277_195|But she might be.
p277_196|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p277_197|It was worth a photograph.
p277_198|They make a selective perception process.
p277_199|We have an election in eight days.
p277_200|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p277_201|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p277_202|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p277_203|Twaddle is a case in point.
p277_204|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p277_205|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p277_206|In each case they were a goal down.
p277_207|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p277_208|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p277_209|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p277_210|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p277_211|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p277_212|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p277_213|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p277_214|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p277_215|It's not before time.
p277_216|The report is due out next month.
p277_217|But she was.
p277_218|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p277_219|At the time, he was a living legend.
p277_220|They must do it.
p277_221|Dewar was certainly under attack from within his own party.
p277_222|However, no further action was taken by police.
p277_223|Until they came to do it.
p277_224|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p277_225|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p277_226|There is no excuse.
p277_228|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p277_229|But it's a subtle process.
p277_230|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p277_231|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p277_232|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p277_233|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p277_234|It is hard won.
p277_235|Our policy is clear.
p277_236|The scene is about this?
p277_237|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p277_238|There wasn't a goal.
p277_239|I should think so, too.
p277_240|There's the mix.
p277_241|The concerns are the same.
p277_242|I can't get a job.
p277_243|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p277_244|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p277_245|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p277_246|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p277_248|Is that a serious question?
p277_249|This is the first step.
p277_250|They must play for each other.
p277_251|Souter will be back.
p277_252|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p277_253|Blood samples were taken.
p277_254|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p277_255|We shall rely on human beings.
p277_256|This is a question of Islam.
p277_257|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p277_258|Immediate action must be taken.
p277_259|It's very nice.
p277_260|He was also married with two children.
p277_261|The system can work.
p277_262|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p277_263|We're in shock.
p277_264|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p277_265|It's a way of life.
p277_266|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p277_267|It was very fast.
p277_268|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p277_269|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p277_270|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p277_271|If not, he should go home.
p277_272|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p277_273|He looked very sharp.
p277_274|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p277_275|All options are open.
p277_276|Dialogue is the key.
p277_277|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p277_278|It was a virus.
p277_279|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p277_280|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p277_281|This is a national crisis.
p277_282|It was good.
p277_283|Who did the recruiting?
p277_284|Bombing slaughter rejected
p277_285|The songs are just so good.
p277_286|The goals will come.
p277_287|There's a pause.
p277_288|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p277_289|I was the sheep.
p277_290|What has altered?
p277_291|I was brought up in a mining background.
p277_292|Nothing is safe.
p277_293|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p277_294|One was a lawyer.
p277_295|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p277_296|They are wrong.
p277_297|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p277_298|The plot is minimal.
p277_299|You are the glory.
p277_300|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p277_301|The letters are going out today.
p277_302|We want to play at the worlds.
p277_303|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
p277_304|My whole life has changed.
p277_305|We are a peaceful people.
p277_306|You may have a short memory.
p277_307|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p277_308|My body is clearly capable.
p277_309|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p277_310|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p277_311|A review is under way.
p277_312|It will work.
p277_313|I came into this world with nothing.
p277_314|It's too horrible to think.
p277_315|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p277_316|Off with their heads.
p277_317|Is there a new way forward?
p277_318|I was invited to work in Germany.
p277_319|Is that an issue?
p277_320|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p277_321|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p277_322|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p277_323|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p277_324|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
p277_325|Well, it won't.
p277_326|These days are long gone.
p277_327|Two people were interviewed.
p277_328|I've got no secret.
p277_329|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p277_330|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p277_331|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p277_332|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p277_333|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p277_334|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p277_335|He loves the big occasions.
p277_336|The performance was excellent.
p277_337|That has been lost.
p277_338|Tell us about it.
p277_339|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p277_340|She said they would appeal.
p277_341|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p277_342|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p277_343|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p277_344|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p277_346|As, indeed, they would be.
p277_347|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p277_348|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p277_349|We will be homeless.
p277_350|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p277_351|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p277_352|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p277_353|There was a substantial explosion.
p277_354|Not so, it seems.
p277_355|He could make it.
p277_356|Four policemen were wounded.
p277_357|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p277_358|It's now down in black and white.
p277_359|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p277_360|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p277_361|They have not done so this season so far.
p277_362|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p277_363|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p277_364|So there, we won.
p277_365|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p277_366|There is no signature.
p277_367|It was a funny game.
p277_368|He was the architect.
p277_369|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p277_370|I've never seen a game like it.
p277_371|I am a wealthy person.
p277_372|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p277_373|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p277_374|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p277_375|Something is wrong.
p277_376|You can cope with it.
p277_377|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p277_378|That's the name of the game, though.
p277_379|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p277_380|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p277_381|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p277_382|At the last I found a bunker.
p277_383|Yet the data is compelling.
p277_384|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p277_385|It's a real problem.
p277_386|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p277_387|I was in the train station overnight.
p277_388|It is unusual.
p277_389|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p277_390|It's like a basketball.
p277_391|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p277_392|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p277_393|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p277_394|It was a kind of contempt.
p277_395|It was a breathtaking moment.
p277_396|The car was just there.
p277_397|It will take place in July.
p277_398|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p277_399|Is that possible?
p277_400|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p277_401|What was the difference between them?
p277_402|Emotions were complex.
p277_403|Then , he laughs.
p277_404|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p277_405|It is an absolute nonsense.
p277_406|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p277_407|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p277_408|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p277_409|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p277_410|Feel the air, the space.
p277_411|He got his degree.
p277_412|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p277_413|went on sale.
p277_414|But we finished the show.
p277_415|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p277_416|The people around me were fantastic.
p277_417|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
p277_418|It is legally binding.
p277_419|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p277_420|There's been a mistake.
p277_421|We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
p277_422|Eriksson would have approved.
p277_423|I am extremely cautious.
p277_424|It was little else.
p277_425|It all began as an accident.
p277_426|The MoD has denied any cover-up.
p277_427|I know the worry over Iraq.
p277_428|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p277_429|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p277_430|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
p277_431|We are all equal.
p277_432|It's been a long, long journey.
p277_433|We were used.
p277_434|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p277_435|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p277_436|They were not even allowed to see them.
p277_437|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p277_438|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p277_439|It won the match.
p277_440|And it showed.
p277_441|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p277_442|I hate the word.
p277_443|Who would be in that desert?
p278_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p278_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p278_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p278_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p278_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p278_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p278_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p278_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p278_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p278_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p278_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p278_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p278_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p278_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p278_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p278_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p278_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p278_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p278_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p278_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p278_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p278_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p278_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p278_025|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p278_026|These decisions are not simple.
p278_027|Life was like a timetable.
p278_028|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p278_029|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p278_030|The director will be present.
p278_031|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p278_032|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p278_033|It carried a double message.
p278_034|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p278_035|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p278_036|Several investments have already been made.
p278_037|It was a hell of a way to lose.
p278_038|Among them are many criminals.
p278_039|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
p278_040|This will get their attention.
p278_041|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p278_042|Well, the climate has changed.
p278_043|Must be prepared to use it.
p278_044|He looks like an Afghan.
p278_045|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p278_046|How are you, sir ?
p278_047|So is that it, then ?
p278_048|Do I have a favourite ?
p278_049|He will need that machine.
p278_050|I have learned from him.
p278_051|I had trouble with the producers.
p278_052|He also presented You Bet!
p278_053|People come to see the Highlands.
p278_054|They are to ensure information reaches as many members as possible.
p278_055|We have not given up hope.
p278_056|She said she was really sorry.
p278_057|None has ever been found.
p278_058|Let's hope that it does.
p278_059|The baby was later transferred to a hospital in Glasgow.
p278_060|It was exactly four months away.
p278_061|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p278_062|Only water is currently allowed.
p278_063|I'm looking to the future.
p278_064|But it has been an amazing experience.
p278_065|The judge was really nice.
p278_066|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p278_067|The fans would love it.
p278_068|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p278_069|The party is up for it.
p278_070|Even the one she loved.
p278_071|It was a unanimous decision.
p278_072|It's all going to clear the debt.
p278_073|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p278_074|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p278_075|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p278_076|By then, he was walking on water.
p278_077|We have to offer value for money.
p278_078|It's so hard to shift.
p278_079|Mr Smith declined to comment.
p278_080|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p278_081|That was a great performance by the team.
p278_082|He said a change in legislation was long overdue.
p278_083|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p278_084|Everyone had to play the game.
p278_085|It was worth a photograph.
p278_086|It was clear on Thursday.
p278_087|It's not a holiday time for football players.
p278_088|But they must believe in themselves.
p278_089|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p278_090|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p278_091|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
p278_092|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p278_093|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p278_094|In the end we made too many errors.
p278_095|That time is not now, however.
p278_096|We created so many chances.
p278_097|Our house was very small.
p278_098|Why do it otherwise ?
p278_099|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p278_100|So, did she meet him ?
p278_101|So what is the campaign about ?
p278_102|And does it ?
p278_103|Are you from the rugby ?
p278_104|Had I heard ?
p278_105|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p278_106|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p278_107|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
p278_108|We have got a race.
p278_109|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
p278_110|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p278_111|He was jailed for a year.
p278_112|They almost achieved a draw.
p278_113|Football is a passion for many.
p278_114|I didn't think so either.
p278_115|It was located on the remote control.
p278_116|Maybe this battle has been.
p278_117|That might help a bit.
p278_118|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p278_119|Ferguson will be a millionaire.
p278_120|You can spend money on housing.
p278_121|The hearing was due to continue today.
p278_122|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p278_123|However, the problem is the timing.
p278_124|This is a frightening development.
p278_125|Which can happen any time.
p278_126|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
p278_127|We had another last Tuesday.
p278_128|I didn't feel under any pressure.
p278_129|This should begin in October.
p278_130|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p278_131|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p278_132|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p278_133|That would open the gates of hell.
p278_134|You've got to be vigilant.
p278_135|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p278_136|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p278_137|Before it was an ordeal.
p278_138|It will affect their work.
p278_139|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p278_140|They could use a boost.
p278_141|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p278_142|Anyone can do the sums.
p278_143|Others are not so sure.
p278_144|I have always loved the countryside.
p278_145|It was his job to check.
p278_146|I haven't made any definite decisions.
p278_147|There's always the next century.
p278_148|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p278_149|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p278_150|I prefer the clarity of the existing system.
p278_151|Nothing was meant by it.
p278_152|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p278_153|Its loss was an economic catastrophe for the whole of Moray.
p278_154|It was by the numbers.
p278_155|I knew he was good.
p278_156|We will turn the corner.
p278_157|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
p278_158|These days are long gone.
p278_159|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p278_160|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p278_161|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p278_162|So was the first half.
p278_163|It's never great to finish second.
p278_164|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p278_165|We have a budget in March.
p278_166|He is keen to stay in public service.
p278_167|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.

p278_169|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p278_170|On my day I can beat anyone.
p278_171|We've made a couple of albums.
p278_172|My life has been destroyed.
p278_173|What happened in that game ?
p278_174|Are you going to win ?
p278_175|Was it the wife ?
p278_176|Why change it ?
p278_177|What do we want to do that for ?
p278_178|I always felt they played for me.
p278_179|His team management was protective.
p278_180|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p278_181|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p278_182|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p278_183|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p278_184|It is vital to clarify their role.
p278_185|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p278_186|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p278_187|Says the Duke of York.
p278_188|That's not fair to the supporters.
p278_189|They need to look after themselves.
p278_190|I've always been like that.
p278_191|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p278_192|They were seriously after him.
p278_193|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p278_194|It shows the strength of the roots.
p278_195|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p278_196|It caused a lot of upset.
p278_197|However, this idea is never developed.
p278_198|I had come back from London.
p278_199|Last night was a key episode.
p278_200|They are still very quiet.
p278_201|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p278_202|I came home by ambulance.
p278_203|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p278_204|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p278_205|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p278_206|We could soon be in that same position!
p278_207|It was a horrible thing to happen.
p278_208|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p278_209|I am very realistic about these things.
p278_210|I won't make an official complaint.
p278_211|He is a good signing for Rangers.
p278_212|Bombing is the easy option.
p278_213|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p278_214|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p278_215|They make a selective perception process.
p278_216|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p278_217|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p278_218|They have known the hard times.
p278_219|It was important to win the singles.
p278_220|The only problem was the greens.
p278_221|January is a bad time of year.
p278_222|His injury was completely random.
p278_223|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p278_224|Twaddle is a case in point.
p278_225|I'm just a regular person.
p278_226|My daughter is an adult.
p278_227|Does the name matter ?
p278_228|how do you get it back ?
p278_229|What are you not good at ?
p278_230|I think, therefore I am ?
p278_231|Who was she ?
p278_232|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p278_233|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p278_234|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p278_235|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p278_236|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p278_237|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p278_238|I have spoken to the skipper.
p278_239|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p278_240|The statement contained no surprises.
p278_241|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p278_242|This would include the GM food industry.
p278_243|My wife and family are the support system.
p278_244|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p278_245|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
p278_246|I need a publishing deal!
p278_247|It had so much to do with output.
p278_248|A fatal accident inquiry will be held into the death.
p278_249|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p278_250|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p278_251|There were no reports of casualties.
p278_252|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p278_253|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p278_254|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p278_255|They made such decisions in London.
p278_256|It seems a waste of talents.
p278_257|I was just getting over the time difference.
p278_258|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p278_259|You can feel at home in China.
p278_260|We have no information on Iraq.
p278_261|Persuaded to change his mind.
p278_262|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p278_263|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p278_264|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p278_265|No production contract is yet in sight.
p278_266|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p278_267|Messages have to be reinforced.
p278_268|It is not enough to be first division champions.
p278_269|We accept the new rules.
p278_270|And they were being paid ?
p278_271|was everything done to save people ?
p278_272|What was the matter for concern ?
p278_273|Do I think about them often ?
p278_274|Is it in the right place ?
p278_275|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p278_276|They are interior designers and architects.
p278_277|He was released after treatment.
p278_278|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p278_279|I'd never run for them.
p278_280|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p278_281|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p278_282|These figures are truly terrible.
p278_283|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p278_284|The stage was set for a showdown.
p278_285|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p278_286|I'd like to report a murder.
p278_287|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p278_288|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
p278_289|Those overseas offices were great.
p278_290|I understand the security issue.
p278_291|Truth is the child of time.
p278_292|It has become a way of life.
p278_293|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p278_294|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p278_295|It was never a free kick.
p278_296|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p278_297|This is a great opportunity for us.
p278_298|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p278_299|You have to expect this type of thing.
p278_300|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p278_301|So the Government will be damaged.
p278_302|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p278_303|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p278_304|John was there already in spirit.
p278_305|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p278_306|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p278_307|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p278_308|He will address the nation this evening.
p278_309|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p278_310|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p278_311|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p278_312|It's not covered by the insurance.
p278_313|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p278_314|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p278_315|You have to see it like this.
p278_316|You have asked for action.
p278_317|Holland won by five wickets.
p278_318|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p278_319|The answer was in space.
p278_320|It's unlikely to be renewed.
p278_321|I first met him last summer.
p278_322|The songs are just so good.
p278_323|The casting is as perfect.
p278_324|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p278_325|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p278_326|McNaughton was not so sure.
p278_327|The dealer is on notice.
p278_328|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p278_329|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p278_330|The party lasted all night.
p278_331|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p278_332|Much the same thing happens in a young company.
p278_333|They come to enjoy themselves.
p278_334|That meant the search was unlawful.
p278_335|And he goes with it.
p278_336|That reflected a tumble in banking shares across the board.
p278_337|We are on a four-year mission.
p278_338|The letters are going out today.
p278_339|We want to play at the worlds.
p278_340|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p278_341|How independent is that ?
p278_342|What form did that take ?
p278_343|What are they for ?
p278_344|Is there a waiting list ?
p278_345|The advisers had some discussions, but no conclusion was reached.
p278_346|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p278_347|And he is immensely loyal.
p278_348|It looks as though the issue, with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p278_349|Other musicians were found in retirement.
p278_350|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p278_351|And it was this one.
p278_352|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
p278_353|My view has now completely changed.
p278_354|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p278_355|He was at school in Devon.
p278_356|Finally came the moment of truth.
p278_357|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p278_358|A crucial moment has arrived.
p278_359|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p278_360|Three years ago he would have been.
p278_361|But we welcome this document.
p278_362|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
p278_363|His views are hardly surprising.
p278_364|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
p278_365|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p278_366|We put our bid in last night.
p278_367|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
p278_368|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p278_369|I was delighted to accept.
p278_370|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p278_371|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p278_372|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
p278_373|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p278_374|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p278_375|He must have seen the movie.
p278_376|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p278_377|The major championships will always have a special place.
p278_378|That is a break with tradition.
p278_379|This decision is a farce.
p278_380|Is it worth it ?
p278_381|Does it matter ?
p278_382|How do you take them away ?
p278_383|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p278_384|After the match, do you ?
p278_385|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p278_386|In due course the deal was done.
p278_387|This remains the party's policy.
p278_388|They will fight for everything.
p278_389|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p278_390|The team hadn't been picked.
p279_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p279_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p279_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p279_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p279_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p279_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p279_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p279_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p279_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p279_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p279_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p279_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p279_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p279_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p279_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p279_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p279_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p279_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p279_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p279_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p279_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p279_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p279_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p279_025|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p279_026|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p279_027|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p279_028|They should be so lucky.
p279_029|Is this accurate?
p279_030|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p279_031|There's a story, too.
p279_032|People love to see this stuff.
p279_033|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p279_034|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p279_035|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p279_036|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p279_037|They're just different.
p279_038|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p279_039|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p279_040|President Bush is at war.
p279_041|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p279_042|I was scared.
p279_043|Dancing was her life.
p279_044|It will come all right.
p279_045|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p279_046|We will push.
p279_047|That period was a struggle.
p279_048|It is urgent.
p279_049|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
p279_050|The judge said.
p279_051|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p279_052|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p279_053|It's a blessing.
p279_054|But it might have done.
p279_055|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p279_056|As she explains.
p279_057|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p279_058|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p279_059|Life is good.
p279_060|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p279_061|Here's a clue.
p279_062|He had no enemies.
p279_063|Sadly, it can't.
p279_064|We have not given up hope.
p279_065|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p279_066|That's the truth.
p279_067|They were too hard.
p279_068|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p279_069|Art is extra.
p279_070|They're appalled by that.
p279_071|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p279_072|Scotland had great assets.
p279_073|He was popular.
p279_074|Have a look at our accounts.
p279_075|It is like a river running by my home.
p279_076|The end result is precisely the same.
p279_077|It seemed so personal.
p279_078|Painful, but only because it's true.
p279_079|He had been a singer.
p279_080|I've been there.
p279_081|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p279_082|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p279_083|She died in hospital two hours later.
p279_084|Is there a new way forward?
p279_085|It works for us.
p279_086|It is a time bomb.
p279_087|This is the way things should be handled.
p279_088|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p279_089|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p279_090|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p279_091|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p279_092|They lived for their children.
p279_093|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p279_094|Yet, it worked.
p279_095|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
p279_096|It is an old family habit.
p279_097|Until you hit the big games.
p279_098|The peace process will be buried!
p279_099|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p279_100|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p279_101|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p279_102|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p279_103|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p279_104|I see no need for change.
p279_105|That would be unlawful.
p279_106|I didn't play well last year.
p279_107|Before the game we went for a pint.
p279_108|They will want to perform well.
p279_109|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p279_110|I don't have many friends.
p279_111|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p279_112|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p279_113|I was angry.
p279_114|This is a step backwards.
p279_115|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p279_116|This film will be totally awesome.
p279_117|My office is bare.
p279_118|Does this mean.
p279_119|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p279_120|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p279_121|Who would have?
p279_122|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p279_123|We work on the same level.
p279_124|You can spend money on housing.
p279_125|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p279_126|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p279_127|I'm so angry.
p279_128|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p279_129|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p279_130|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p279_131|Well, you can have a tree.
p279_132|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p279_133|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
p279_134|It will be too hot.
p279_135|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p279_136|I am now unemployed.
p279_137|You've got to be vigilant.
p279_138|It's perfectly feasible.
p279_139|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p279_140|This represents a tough game for us.
p279_141|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p279_142|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p279_143|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p279_144|Is that Titanic?
p279_145|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p279_146|It is like a football team.
p279_147|I am just trying to do my job.
p279_148|They did very well.
p279_149|You know the type.
p279_150|In each case they were a goal down.
p279_151|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p279_152|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p279_153|It was the same at Twickenham.
p279_154|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p279_155|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p279_156|This latter point is hugely important.
p279_157|I am very happy with life.
p279_158|These days are long gone.
p279_159|It is an attitude of mind.
p279_160|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p279_161|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p279_162|As, indeed, they would be.
p279_163|I have got a wife to feed.
p279_164|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p279_165|Tell it like it was?
p279_166|It is not too late to get on board.
p279_167|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p279_168|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p279_169|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p279_170|Nobody did in those days.
p279_171|My life has been destroyed.
p279_172|His team management was protective.
p279_173|Is Saddam a threat?
p279_174|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p279_175|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p279_176|It is not either national standards or local control.
p279_177|The clarity is vital.
p279_178|The hotel was now for sale.
p279_179|I drove the ball well.
p279_180|That has been the easy part.
p279_181|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p279_182|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p279_183|Government will intervene.
p279_184|We knew nothing about it.
p279_185|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p279_186|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p279_187|It's a joke.
p279_188|Does this matter?
p279_189|It just came into my head that day.
p279_190|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p279_191|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p279_192|It is tough, but possible.
p279_193|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p279_194|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p279_195|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p279_196|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p279_197|It was typical.
p279_198|Our strategy is straightforward.
p279_199|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p279_200|I have a cold.
p279_201|Tommy is not a problem.
p279_202|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p279_203|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p279_204|He had suffered a heart attack.
p279_205|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p279_206|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p279_207|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p279_208|There was no rescue.
p279_209|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p279_210|I don't want to use it.
p279_211|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p279_212|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p279_213|The road was closed for several hours.
p279_214|That is an important part of our role.
p279_215|Twaddle is a case in point.
p279_216|I am delighted for Simon.
p279_217|By hard work, is the answer.
p279_218|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p279_219|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p279_220|His death was a tragic accident.
p279_221|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p279_222|He's a nice guy.
p279_223|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p279_224|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p279_225|I am immensely sad.
p279_226|I'd never seen a play about me.
p279_227|It is a gamble.
p279_228|My neighbours are horrified.
p279_229|At the time, he was a living legend.
p279_230|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p279_231|They are the innocent victims.
p279_232|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
p279_233|Broke the birdie record.
p279_234|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p279_235|It is set in Paris.
p279_236|They should come forward.
p279_237|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p279_238|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p279_239|You take a risk.
p279_240|It's too much work.
p279_241|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p279_242|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p279_243|He will go a long way.
p279_244|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p279_245|The scene is about this?
p279_246|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p279_247|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p279_248|He's a lovely young man.
p279_249|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p279_250|This year I understood.
p279_251|This is the culture change in medicine.
p279_252|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p279_253|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p279_254|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p279_255|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p279_256|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p279_257|This is a big club.
p279_258|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p279_259|they fail to engage.
p279_260|People should not become complacent.
p279_261|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p279_262|The warning is timely.
p279_263|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p279_264|Blood samples were taken.
p279_265|It looks as though he will be right.
p279_266|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p279_267|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p279_268|It's very nice.
p279_269|It left me with a sadness.
p279_270|It was an easy decision to come here.
p279_271|It is the same in Sweden.
p279_272|That could be in place by next year.
p279_273|Things can change.
p279_274|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p279_275|The script was funny.
p279_276|They seem to get away with it.
p279_277|She looked so young.
p279_278|It happens from time to time.
p279_279|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p279_280|They expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured.
p279_281|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p279_282|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p279_283|You've got to have both sides.
p279_284|The attacker died in the crash.
p279_285|It was a virus.
p279_286|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p279_287|Who will perform?
p279_288|It's like a high school play.
p279_289|It was hopeless.
p279_290|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
p279_291|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p279_292|He wrote the letter two days before he died.
p279_293|It changed my life.
p279_294|These figures are truly awful.
p279_295|He should have won.
p279_296|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p279_297|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p279_298|What has altered?
p279_299|Graeme was prepared.
p279_300|I thought it was my only chance.
p279_301|One was a lawyer.
p279_302|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p279_303|They are wrong.
p279_304|This is a war over our home.
p279_305|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p279_306|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p279_307|It was entirely justified.
p279_308|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p279_309|It's certainly different.
p279_310|The letters are going out today.
p279_311|I did not name it.
p279_312|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p279_313|Special measures were needed.
p279_314|It is all credit to them today.
p279_315|They were fantastic.
p279_316|Craig is a major concern for us.
p279_317|My body is clearly capable.
p279_318|I came into this world with nothing.
p279_319|The airport was even different.
p279_320|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p279_321|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p279_322|He got the same story.
p279_323|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p279_324|He was then replaced by Ross.
p279_325|She did not attend the courtroom.
p279_326|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p279_327|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p279_328|Was this element always there?
p279_329|They haven't got a hope.
p279_330|He did a good job.
p279_331|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p279_332|It is so unfair.
p279_333|It will be very, very tight.
p279_334|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p279_335|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p279_336|The composer will conduct.
p279_337|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
p279_338|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p279_339|The boat was fantastic.
p279_340|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p279_341|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p279_342|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p279_343|You need a licence to run a pub.
p279_344|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p279_345|The salary changes are long overdue.
p279_346|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p279_347|It is horrible.
p279_348|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p279_349|I kept going for her.
p279_350|He has seen the past.
p279_351|Hartley should know.
p279_352|We are looking for perfection.
p279_353|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p279_354|It's that sort of night.
p279_355|He could make it.
p279_356|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p279_357|I lost my head.
p279_358|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p279_359|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p279_360|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p279_361|Well, the big day has arrived.
p279_362|So there, we won.
p279_363|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p279_364|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
p279_365|There is no signature.
p279_366|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p279_367|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p279_368|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p279_369|He has the edge.
p279_370|Again, we were lucky.
p279_371|He denied the charge.
p279_372|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p279_373|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p279_374|That's the name of the game, though.
p279_375|YOU thought it was a headache.
p279_376|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p279_377|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p279_378|It doesn't always work that way.
p279_379|I'm pleased about one thing.
p279_380|We try to keep it right.
p279_381|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p279_382|It's like a basketball.
p279_383|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p279_384|I can lead by example.
p279_385|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p279_386|He is on the wrong side.
p280_001|Please call Stella.
p280_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p280_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p280_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p280_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p280_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p280_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p280_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p280_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p280_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p280_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p280_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p280_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p280_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p280_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p280_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p280_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p280_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p280_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p280_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p280_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p280_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p280_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p280_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p280_025|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
p280_026|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
p280_027|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
p280_028|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
p280_029|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
p280_030|She brought a lot to my life.
p280_031|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
p280_032|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
p280_033|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
p280_034|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
p280_035|It is about control of our economy.
p280_036|Each brand was owned by a different family.
p280_037|That was not perfect golf by any means.
p280_038|He added that her comments were noted.
p280_039|She will get through it I'm sure.
p280_040|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p280_041|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
p280_042|He does not even trust his own members.
p280_043|He too started on the subs seats.
p280_044|Is it worth it ?
p280_045|Does it matter ?
p280_046|How do you take them away ?
p280_047|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p280_048|After the match, do you ?
p280_049|Has the conflict started ?
p280_050|Have I really come to this ?
p280_051|I'm as fit as I can get.
p280_052|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
p280_053|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
p280_054|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
p280_055|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
p280_056|They seem too much of a sure thing.
p280_057|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p280_058|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p280_059|We just want this season to end.
p280_060|It was a day she thought she would never see.
p280_061|Talks have continued at many different levels.
p280_062|The referee is there to decide these things.
p280_063|There were no details of the other five victims.
p280_064|It also has a good labour supply.
p280_065|Indeed he has a lot of output.
p280_066|Do not give your details to anyone.
p280_067|He was failed by his health authority.
p280_068|But it was not all bad news.
p280_069|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
p280_070|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
p280_071|It turned me against the whole system.
p280_072|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
p280_073|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
p280_074|But two groups refused to sign up.
p280_075|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
p280_076|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p280_077|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
p280_078|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p280_079|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
p280_080|They said our costs were too high.
p280_081|I do not attempt to answer that.
p280_082|It's been a great evening for us.
p280_083|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p280_084|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
p280_085|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p280_086|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
p280_087|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
p280_088|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p280_089|I feel I did not have enough time.
p280_090|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p280_091|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p280_092|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
p280_093|They had the appeal of TV stars.
p280_094|There is no issue of national security involved here.
p280_095|He will be a very hard act to follow.
p280_096|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p280_097|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p280_098|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
p280_099|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
p280_100|I am delighted to hear this news.
p280_101|We are already seeing some positive results.
p280_102|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
p280_103|We were under a bit of pressure.
p280_104|They won't actually make any money from it.
p280_105|I bought a flat six years ago.
p280_106|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p280_107|They are a different team at home.
p280_108|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
p280_109|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
p280_110|Some young girls also came by last night.
p280_111|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
p280_112|What are they for ?
p280_113|Is there a waiting list ?
p280_114|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p280_115|So what happens next ?
p280_116|Had this been common practice ?
p280_117|What do they want us to do ?
p280_118|The idea is the shop within a shop.
p280_119|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
p280_120|It is the right package for Scotland.
p280_121|They have no real friends in the region.
p280_122|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p280_123|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p280_124|In Glasgow, a sheriff dismissed five cases yesterday without hearing evidence.
p280_125|I think there's not much between them.
p280_126|So I am going in the right direction.
p280_127|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p280_128|We have to offer value for money.
p280_129|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
p280_130|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
p280_131|He's got to look after himself now.
p280_132|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
p280_133|No country has a similar training programme.
p280_134|There is no future in rock music.
p280_135|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
p280_136|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
p280_137|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
p280_138|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
p280_139|The programme has been made with great care.
p280_140|There was only one living room, you see.
p280_141|I am not under any new pressure.
p280_142|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p280_143|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
p280_144|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
p280_145|All eight victims were based in Germany.
p280_146|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
p280_147|You should feel involved in their lives.
p280_148|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p280_149|Is it in the right place ?
p280_150|Did he trip ?
p280_151|Does that put pressure on us ?
p280_152|Did it work ?
p280_153|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p280_154|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
p280_155|Time may already have run out for this option.
p280_156|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
p280_157|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
p280_158|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
p280_159|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
p280_160|A progress report will be published in October.
p280_161|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
p280_162|That will reduce my chance of selection.
p280_163|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
p280_164|Surely it can't run for two years.
p280_165|But the game is still wide open.
p280_166|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
p280_167|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
p280_168|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
p280_169|We had to work very hard for our points.
p280_170|That is a big risk at any price.
p280_171|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p280_172|He said some things which were better left alone.
p280_173|If successful, several records will be made.
p280_174|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
p280_175|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p280_176|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
p280_177|It's just a different way of life.
p280_178|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p280_179|Nato has left them with no other option.
p280_180|I am secure in my own position.
p280_181|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
p280_182|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p280_183|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
p280_184|We have come a long way since then.
p280_185|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p280_186|A great player has to win major championships.
p280_187|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
p280_188|I didn't miss the big house at all.
p280_189|The story was not made public by this club.
p280_190|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
p280_191|You are not long home from work.
p280_192|I am fighting the force of nature.
p280_193|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p280_194|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
p280_195|And they were being paid ?
p280_196|was everything done to save people ?
p280_197|What was the matter for concern ?
p280_198|But they had to be paid for.
p280_199|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
p280_200|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
p280_201|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
p280_202|I've never had a year like this.
p280_203|Full details are expected to be released in June.
p280_204|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
p280_205|Hague will be leader at the election after next.
p280_206|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p280_207|I want an answer from the British Government.
p280_208|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
p280_209|They are a victim of their own success.
p280_210|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p280_211|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
p280_212|It is going to change the world.
p280_213|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
p280_214|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
p280_215|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
p280_216|I am not going to judge them.
p280_217|I do not see this so much as failure.
p280_218|A European final must be the millennium target.
p280_219|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p280_220|I was independent but I am not now.
p280_221|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
p280_222|We are still seeking that complete performance.
p280_223|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
p280_224|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
p280_225|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
p280_226|If not, a deal could take many months.
p280_227|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
p280_228|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
p280_229|I want to see as much progress as possible.
p280_230|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
p280_231|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
p280_232|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
p280_233|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
p280_234|The labour side has developed in the North area.
p280_235|You are not allowed to do that.
p280_236|That is the last thing they need.
p280_237|He has worked for several years in the United States.
p280_238|The children were later able to leave by bus.
p280_239|Jim was down there with his wife.
p280_240|Was it the wife ?
p280_241|Why change it ?
p280_242|What do we want to do that for ?
p280_243|Does the name matter ?
p280_244|how do you get it back ?
p280_245|What are you not good at ?
p280_246|I think, therefore I am ?
p280_247|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
p280_248|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
p280_249|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
p280_250|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p280_251|However, the figures tell a different story.
p280_252|The rise has come too late for some.
p280_253|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
p280_254|I'd rather play well next week than here.
p280_255|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
p280_256|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
p280_257|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
p280_258|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
p280_259|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
p280_260|And they never show the same film as a rival.
p280_261|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
p280_262|There would be a north and south division.
p280_263|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
p280_264|The two companies were not for sale.
p280_265|His condition was described as serious last night.
p280_266|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p280_267|The board do not own the company.
p280_268|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
p280_269|They always want to give a performance.
p280_270|Its primary business channel is the internet.
p280_271|That's been the difference between the sides.
p280_272|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
p280_273|I think I was about four years old.
p280_274|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
p280_275|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
p280_276|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
p280_277|I think the shares are good value.
p280_278|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p280_279|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
p280_280|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
p280_281|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
p280_282|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
p280_283|He may be ready for first team action in March.
p280_284|The fans pay for their season tickets.
p280_285|There was just fire all around me.
p280_286|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
p280_287|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p280_288|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
p280_289|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
p280_290|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
p280_291|He would get into any world team.
p280_292|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
p280_293|They first met during a Step in London.
p280_294|The agreement remains the only show in town.
p280_295|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p280_296|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p280_297|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p280_298|It is based on population rather than need.
p280_299|He could understand both points of view.
p280_300|So, did she meet him ?
p280_301|So what is the campaign about ?
p280_302|And does it ?
p280_303|Are you from the rugby ?
p280_304|Had I heard ?
p280_305|What happened in that game ?
p280_306|Are you going to win ?
p280_307|It might have led to a screen career, but it didn't.
p280_308|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
p280_309|It had happened on average once a week this year.
p280_310|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p280_311|He is keen to stay in public service.
p280_312|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
p280_313|For that reason cover should not be given.
p280_314|He felt too close to head office.
p280_315|If you believe in the blue and white.
p280_316|A report on their property is due within days.
p280_317|He will just go on doing his job.
p280_318|I always felt they played for me.
p280_319|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p280_320|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
p280_321|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
p280_322|We will not simply hit these people.
p280_323|We still think this trade is on the increase.
p280_324|It is not either national standards or local control.
p280_325|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
p280_326|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
p280_327|I try to be open to experience.
p280_328|He is not exactly a pretty child.
p280_329|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
p280_330|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p280_331|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
p280_332|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
p280_333|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
p280_334|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
p280_335|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
p280_336|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
p280_337|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p280_338|How are you, sir ?
p280_339|So is that it, then ?
p280_340|Do I have a favourite ?
p280_341|Put another way, they just won't do it.
p280_342|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
p280_343|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
p280_344|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
p280_345|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
p280_346|It was a bit like having children.
p280_347|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
p280_348|And that is the bottom line - box office.
p280_349|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
p280_350|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
p280_351|I think we are back on track.
p280_352|Sales will begin by the end of October.
p280_353|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
p280_354|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p280_355|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
p280_356|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
p280_357|It is the only natural British site on the list.
p280_358|His style was direct and very human.
p280_359|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
p280_360|They have the cash and the fire power.
p280_361|The institute board will take the decision.
p280_362|He's young enough and he must learn.
p280_363|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
p280_364|Both players gave so much to the side.
p280_365|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p280_366|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p280_367|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
p280_368|It was a goal which came from nothing.
p280_369|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
p280_370|I have come here to show support for the families.
p280_371|We have been going for three years.
p280_372|He really played us into a corner.
p280_373|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
p280_374|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
p280_375|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
p280_376|It used to be all hard sell.
p280_377|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
p280_378|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
p280_379|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p280_380|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
p280_381|This is not a small amount of money.
p280_382|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
p280_383|I just felt that I was broken down.
p280_384|What do we do ?
p280_385|Why do it otherwise ?
p280_386|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p280_387|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
p280_388|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
p280_389|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p280_390|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
p281_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p281_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p281_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p281_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p281_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p281_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p281_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p281_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p281_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p281_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p281_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p281_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p281_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p281_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p281_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p281_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p281_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p281_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p281_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p281_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p281_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p281_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p281_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p281_025|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p281_026|They are very clever in their use of words.
p281_027|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p281_028|Smoking is also very important.
p281_029|It's not going to work out that way.
p281_030|They've got their own agenda.
p281_031|I'd just like to play.
p281_032|Our fans have been marvellous.
p281_033|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p281_034|He should emerge as the winner.
p281_035|She failed in her action.
p281_036|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p281_037|It carried a double message.
p281_038|It is a financial matter.
p281_039|This film will be totally awesome.
p281_040|They want to be entertained.
p281_041|A week is a long time in politics.
p281_042|I am just going to go for it.
p281_043|There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
p281_044|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p281_045|Among them are many criminals.
p281_046|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p281_047|He looks like an Afghan.
p281_048|That was the theory, anyway.
p281_049|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p281_050|I had come back from London.
p281_051|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p281_052|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p281_053|I must take a seat.
p281_054|That is very hard, alone.
p281_055|The Government should be ashamed.
p281_056|None has ever been found.
p281_057|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p281_058|We should be able to cope.
p281_059|It was a lovely experience.
p281_060|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p281_061|We will pay their bills.
p281_062|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p281_063|The standard is extremely high.
p281_064|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p281_065|Only water is currently allowed.
p281_066|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p281_067|It is a real problem.
p281_068|I have proved that in the past.
p281_069|He had been a singer.
p281_070|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p281_071|How are you, sir ?
p281_072|So is that it, then ?
p281_073|Do I have a favourite ?
p281_074|The players will be down.
p281_075|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p281_076|There could be a lot of confusion.
p281_077|He also received a medal of honour.
p281_078|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p281_079|Mini rugby is a great thing.
p281_080|He is in the queue.
p281_081|I first met him last summer.
p281_082|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p281_083|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p281_084|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p281_085|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p281_086|The error appeared in a warrant.
p281_087|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
p281_088|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
p281_089|IT is called a killing in the trade.
p281_090|It was worth a photograph.
p281_091|We could not get any possession.
p281_092|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p281_093|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p281_094|The conclusion is the same.
p281_095|It is a vicious circle.
p281_096|But I know the course.
p281_097|We must stop it with the golf ball.
p281_098|We live by the rule of law.
p281_099|This is a national crisis.
p281_100|Otherwise, the market may come back.
p281_101|The following are the principal provisions.
p281_102|Movement has to take place.
p281_103|City sentiment is in his favour.
p281_104|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p281_105|It's not a lack of confidence.
p281_106|It was a funny game.
p281_107|What do we do ?
p281_108|Why do it otherwise ?
p281_109|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p281_110|That is the only way forward.
p281_111|They are at a very early stage.
p281_112|The whole thing is the music.
p281_113|Or it would have been.
p281_114|His is a success story by any standard.
p281_115|Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
p281_116|Such actions are rarely popular.
p281_117|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
p281_118|It is much as it has been described.
p281_119|They've got to account for it.
p281_120|Then again, we could have.
p281_121|We have a training class.
p281_122|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p281_123|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p281_124|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p281_125|She does not want to speak.
p281_126|Scottish Life was there over one year.
p281_127|Twaddle is a case in point.
p281_128|That is far too high.
p281_129|They made such decisions in London.
p281_130|There were no serious injuries.
p281_131|She was also very brave.
p281_132|He wants to win a major.
p281_133|First meeting was next week.
p281_134|I never wanted a legal battle.
p281_135|We will try to find someone.
p281_136|People come from all round the world to see it.
p281_137|We have seen a copy of the report.
p281_138|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p281_139|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
p281_140|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p281_141|It is not just about pay.
p281_142|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p281_143|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p281_144|I was caught out a little bit.
p281_145|The FBI could become involved.
p281_146|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p281_147|Three hours later, the man was free.
p281_148|We have a clean bill of health.
p281_149|It is not normal practice.
p281_150|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p281_151|The family kept away from me.
p281_152|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p281_153|My Dad is a hero.
p281_154|So what is the campaign about ?
p281_155|And does it ?
p281_156|Are you from the rugby ?
p281_157|Had I heard ?
p281_158|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p281_159|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p281_160|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p281_161|The strong pound also took its toll.
p281_162|It is a terrible tragedy.
p281_163|Shareholders may have to wait until June to be paid.
p281_164|I have got a wife to feed.
p281_165|We have a budget in March.
p281_166|The pension levels will remain the same.
p281_167|They will do their own thing.
p281_168|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p281_169|Our position remains the same.
p281_170|It's nice to be nice.
p281_171|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p281_172|They could not match it.
p281_173|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
p281_174|Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
p281_175|One season, they might do well.
p281_176|You've got to be vigilant.
p281_177|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p281_178|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p281_179|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p281_180|It is not either national standards or local control.
p281_181|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p281_182|The hotel was now for sale.
p281_183|I can't even get into the A team.
p281_184|They know no other way.
p281_185|The referee had a good game.
p281_186|I am not ready to walk away.
p281_187|Says the Duke of York.
p281_188|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
p281_189|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p281_190|He prefers to play for them.
p281_191|I have accepted the challenge.
p281_192|You know the sort of thing.
p281_193|They were seriously after him.
p281_194|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p281_195|And this game is all about belief.
p281_196|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p281_197|That would be my view.
p281_198|It decided to blame the media.
p281_199|We always felt we could win.
p281_200|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p281_201|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p281_202|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p281_203|Because he was born in England.
p281_204|There was no way back for United after that.
p281_205|It was a test in itself.
p281_206|No details of the talks were given.
p281_207|This will be our new beginning.
p281_208|They have the cash and the fire power.
p281_209|We believe a third party was involved.
p281_210|Tommy is not a problem.
p281_211|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p281_212|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p281_213|This is a holy place.
p281_214|He had suffered a heart attack.
p281_215|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p281_216|You have caught a serial killer.
p281_217|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p281_218|You are a great player.
p281_219|What do we want to do that for ?
p281_220|Does the name matter ?
p281_221|how do you get it back ?
p281_222|What are you not good at ?
p281_223|You have got to look at speed of response.
p281_224|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p281_225|We're very unhappy about it.
p281_226|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p281_227|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p281_228|I had relied on him.
p281_229|I'm just a regular person.
p281_230|It had all been arranged.
p281_231|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p281_232|I am considered a teenager.
p281_233|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p281_234|This will secure the future of our industry.
p281_235|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p281_236|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p281_237|It was a crazy day.
p281_238|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p281_239|That has been the easy part.
p281_240|You could feel the heat.
p281_241|We played them off the pitch.
p281_242|After that nothing could save him.
p281_243|This is the year of the Tiger.
p281_244|Wilson will tell the truth.
p281_245|She died in middle age.
p281_246|We just had a go.
p281_247|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p281_248|It is set in Paris.
p281_249|He has run a hell of a race.
p281_250|That is still in place.
p281_251|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p281_252|The irony was not lost.
p281_253|The pig industry is on its knees.
p281_254|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p281_255|The minister is the engineer.
p281_256|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p281_257|She took them for a term.
p281_258|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p281_259|You can never tell with the manager.
p281_260|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p281_261|Persuaded to change his mind.
p281_262|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p281_263|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
p281_264|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p281_265|I should think so, too.
p281_266|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p281_267|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p281_268|That would depend on the parole board.
p281_269|The capital costs are modest.
p281_270|That could be in place by next year.
p281_271|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p281_272|He looked like a schoolboy.
p281_273|England could only play the other team on the park.
p281_274|He took over our lives.
p281_275|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p281_276|We feel very good about it.
p281_277|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p281_278|For him then it's a labour of love.
p281_279|We are aiming for early March.
p281_280|It is also very valuable.
p281_281|The demand is created by the supply.
p281_282|Not many companies can say that these days.
p281_283|I realised I was lucky to have it.
p281_284|That view has not altered.
p281_285|And they were being paid ?
p281_286|was everything done to save people ?
p281_287|What was the matter for concern ?
p281_288|Do I think about them often ?
p281_289|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p281_290|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p281_291|He was also married with two children.
p281_292|The target is to break even by Christmas.
p281_293|You have to expect this type of thing.
p281_294|They seem to get away with it.
p281_295|We have to be very, very careful.
p281_296|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p281_297|It is a symbolic concert.
p281_298|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p281_299|This is the correct decision.
p281_300|He added that the business was in good shape.
p281_301|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p281_302|Scotch beef is badly missed.
p281_303|The rescue package is public money.
p281_304|We are not doing the Today programme.
p281_305|There should be room for creative dissent.
p281_306|These figures are truly awful.
p281_307|We need to increase the membership.
p281_308|The real issue is personal.
p281_309|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p281_310|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p281_311|He was at home with his pals.
p281_312|The dealer is on notice.
p281_313|The party lasted all night.
p281_314|We are in the end game.
p281_315|They come to enjoy themselves.
p281_316|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p281_317|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p281_318|That meant the search was unlawful.
p281_319|This may be perfectly innocent.
p281_320|Scotland has shown the way.
p281_321|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p281_322|The letters are going out today.
p281_323|I can see their argument.
p281_324|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p281_325|It is all credit to them today.
p281_326|The whole family was in shock.
p281_327|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p281_328|The actor has met with Mandela.
p281_329|There is no shortage of farmers.
p281_330|It's difficult to predict the future.
p281_331|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p281_332|But the Farmer is bemused.
p281_333|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p281_334|However, the groups denied the claims.
p281_335|The airport was even different.
p281_336|There was no time scale.
p281_337|Does that put pressure on us ?
p281_338|Did it work ?
p281_339|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p281_340|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p281_341|It's just the way I play.
p281_342|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p281_343|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p281_344|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p281_345|I have a moral dilemma.
p281_346|It was almost too much.
p281_347|It will now be unveiled in the US in July.
p281_348|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p281_349|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p281_350|He did a good job.
p281_351|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p281_352|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
p281_353|I think this proposal is excellent.
p281_354|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p281_355|He deserves a top team.
p281_356|It is all about having physical evidence.
p281_357|It should be a great game, though.
p281_358|I said she was very young.
p281_359|He had no previous convictions.
p281_360|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p281_361|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p281_362|Neither woman has been named.
p281_363|They should take their mobile phones.
p281_364|You need a licence to run a pub.
p281_365|I got a yellow card.
p281_366|There will be no final dividend.
p281_367|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p281_368|The major championships will always have a special place.
p281_369|She said they would appeal.
p281_370|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p281_371|There is no deal as yet.
p281_372|It's as wide as a church in here.
p281_373|The shares are a strong hold.
p281_374|It would be quite nice.
p281_375|There was a thing in front of the camera.
p281_376|The pair are very much in love.
p281_377|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p281_378|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
p281_379|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p281_380|I wanted to go out on a high.
p281_381|He has seen the past.
p281_382|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p281_383|He has an equity stake in the investment house.
p281_384|Our policy is very clear on this issue.
p281_385|He has been a success this year.
p281_386|In fact, he was great today.
p281_387|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p281_388|A review is under way.
p281_389|It is a simple equation.
p281_390|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p281_391|I was as strong as a horse.
p281_392|I had a fortunate war.
p281_393|Are they free ?
p281_394|What are they for ?
p281_395|Is there a waiting list ?
p281_396|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p281_397|That investment has now been secured.
p281_398|He had returned to die.
p281_399|It is hard to understand.
p281_400|Adventure is the champagne of life.
p281_401|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p281_402|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p281_403|The casualties were not named.
p281_404|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p281_405|It had been on the cards.
p281_406|He took a draw on his cigarette.
p281_407|It was the same expression of joy.
p281_408|There is a solution, she believes.
p281_409|Yet the data is compelling.
p281_410|That was a touch of class.
p281_411|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p281_412|That is a personal matter.
p281_413|He seems to be used to the attention.
p281_414|We will stand for the nation.
p281_415|Is it worth it ?
p281_416|Does it matter ?
p281_417|How do you take them away ?
p281_418|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p281_419|After the match, do you ?
p281_420|I am delighted for them.
p281_421|Footballers have also been targeted.
p281_422|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p281_423|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p281_424|My aim is a top six finish.
p281_425|That's the way it works.
p281_426|The professor is in no doubt.
p281_427|It was a poor performance.
p281_428|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p281_429|John Daly has a burning ambition.
p281_430|Once again, they would be wrong.
p281_431|Together, we can make a difference.
p281_432|He will be judged by his actions.
p281_433|It is an absolute nonsense.
p281_434|We might be back next year.
p281_435|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p281_436|Size is not the issue.
p281_437|It was support as it should be.
p281_438|I didn't get to keep it.
p281_439|It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
p281_440|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
p282_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p282_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p282_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p282_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p282_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p282_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p282_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p282_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p282_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p282_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p282_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p282_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p282_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p282_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p282_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p282_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p282_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p282_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p282_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p282_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p282_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p282_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p282_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p282_025|But it failed.
p282_026|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p282_027|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p282_028|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p282_029|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p282_030|This is the window.
p282_031|He was jailed for five years.
p282_032|Help is needed.
p282_033|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p282_034|It is marvellous.
p282_035|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p282_036|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p282_037|They're just different.
p282_038|It was clear.
p282_039|Indeed, he does.
p282_040|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p282_041|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p282_042|Dancing was her life.
p282_043|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p282_044|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p282_045|They want to be entertained.
p282_046|It's the only thing.
p282_047|You had better believe it.
p282_048|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p282_049|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p282_050|A neighbour said.
p282_051|It is bizarre.
p282_052|There is no reason at all.
p282_053|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p282_054|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p282_055|Our people are ready.
p282_056|Here's a clue.
p282_057|I was lost.
p282_058|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p282_059|My fitness was very poor.
p282_060|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p282_061|It is unique.
p282_062|I expect a rapid response.
p282_063|It happened so quickly.
p282_064|That's the truth.
p282_065|It seems to have worked.
p282_066|This is the first step.
p282_067|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p282_068|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p282_069|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p282_070|But I've won both ways.
p282_071|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p282_072|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p282_073|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p282_074|It could take some time.
p282_075|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p282_076|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p282_077|It is a job creation scheme.
p282_078|The party is up for it.
p282_079|People must remain vigilant.
p282_080|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p282_081|What has changed?
p282_082|I will miss him.
p282_083|He is in the queue.
p282_084|I first met him last summer.
p282_085|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p282_086|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p282_087|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p282_088|They lived for their children.
p282_089|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p282_090|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p282_091|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p282_092|We are on the path of change.
p282_093|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p282_094|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
p282_095|Yet, it worked.
p282_096|He's been hit by it.
p282_097|I love the Dome.
p282_098|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p282_099|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p282_100|It is a love affair.
p282_101|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p282_102|They make a selective perception process.
p282_103|Two of the team became ill.
p282_104|That would be unlawful.
p282_105|I don't want to use it.
p282_106|Oil embargo endorsed.
p282_107|It was an adventure.
p282_108|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p282_109|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p282_110|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p282_111|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p282_112|Is that right?
p282_113|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p282_114|It's a shame.
p282_115|It was the eighties.
p282_116|It is so sad.
p282_117|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p282_118|The mood is upbeat.
p282_119|It is rubbish.
p282_120|Who would be a referee?
p282_121|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p282_122|We enjoyed it today.
p282_123|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p282_124|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p282_125|There were no grounds for his action.
p282_126|I'm so angry.
p282_127|She really suffered for her art.
p282_128|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p282_129|It is not a U-turn.
p282_130|No production was achieved.
p282_131|I am now unemployed.
p282_132|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
p282_133|It plans to return to this field.
p282_134|We work well together.
p282_135|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p282_136|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p282_137|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p282_138|I was dead.
p282_139|I don't know the full story.
p282_140|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p282_141|She died at her home.
p282_142|He realises his mistake.
p282_143|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p282_144|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p282_145|I was awful.
p282_146|Who would have?
p282_147|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p282_148|It is not just about pay.
p282_149|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p282_150|There was a substantial explosion.
p282_151|I was stunned.
p282_152|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p282_153|The weather forecast isn't good.
p282_154|They have not been named.
p282_155|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p282_156|My Dad is a hero.
p282_157|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p282_158|Words were not required.
p282_159|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p282_160|Life becomes a song.
p282_161|Well, he should know.
p282_162|Was this element always there?
p282_163|These days are long gone.
p282_164|I'd love to be like Peter.
p282_165|I've put my own money into this project.
p282_166|It has to be now.
p282_167|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p282_168|I was in the train station overnight.
p282_169|We have a budget in March.
p282_170|We should do everything at a stroke.
p282_171|You had to go and see him.
p282_172|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p282_173|In a way he was.
p282_174|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p282_175|Blair's response was weak.
p282_176|As we worked.
p282_177|We are the gateway to justice.
p282_178|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p282_179|The goals were good.
p282_180|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p282_181|It's an idea.
p282_182|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p282_183|They need to look after themselves.
p282_184|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p282_185|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p282_186|Does this matter?
p282_187|Our team is just so young.
p282_188|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p282_189|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p282_190|It caused a lot of upset.
p282_191|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p282_192|We speak about the performance.
p282_193|It is a farce.
p282_194|Peace was won.
p282_195|It's a fact.
p282_196|I came home by ambulance.
p282_197|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p282_198|Is that success?
p282_199|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p282_200|Who will pay for this?
p282_201|It's all about money, money, money.
p282_202|Sadly, it can't.
p282_203|It was worth a photograph.
p282_204|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p282_205|We have an election in eight days.
p282_206|Feel the heat?
p282_207|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p282_208|Twaddle is a case in point.
p282_209|It had all been arranged.
p282_210|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p282_211|Work has started.
p282_212|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p282_213|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p282_214|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p282_215|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p282_216|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p282_217|Then another one came.
p282_218|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p282_219|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p282_220|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p282_221|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p282_222|I'd never seen a play about me.
p282_223|It's not before time.
p282_224|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p282_225|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p282_226|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p282_227|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p282_228|My wife and family are the support system.
p282_229|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p282_230|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p282_231|We are so proud.
p282_232|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p282_233|Of course I was tempted.
p282_234|It's quite a line-up!
p282_235|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p282_236|The minister is the engineer.
p282_237|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p282_238|It is hard won.
p282_239|Our policy is clear.
p282_240|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p282_241|The scene is about this?
p282_242|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p282_243|My son was too young to die.
p282_244|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p282_245|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p282_246|It was a hit.
p282_247|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p282_248|That could be in place by next year.
p282_249|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p282_250|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p282_251|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p282_252|they fail to engage.
p282_253|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p282_254|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p282_255|They must play for each other.
p282_256|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p282_257|There's not much money in cycling.
p282_258|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p282_259|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p282_260|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p282_261|He has not created a Festival resource.
p282_262|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p282_263|He was also married with two children.
p282_264|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p282_265|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p282_266|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p282_267|One knows the feeling.
p282_268|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p282_269|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p282_270|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p282_271|She failed in her action.
p282_272|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p282_273|She looked so young.
p282_274|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p282_275|It's so awful.
p282_276|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p282_277|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p282_278|You've got to have both sides.
p282_279|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p282_280|Dialogue is the key.
p282_281|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p282_282|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p282_283|Who will perform?
p282_284|This is a national crisis.
p282_285|Who did the recruiting?
p282_286|She is really magic.
p282_287|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p282_288|I was the sheep.
p282_289|I was brought up in a mining background.
p282_290|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p282_291|Nothing is safe.
p282_292|But it's a subtle process.
p282_293|One was a lawyer.
p282_294|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p282_295|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p282_296|They are wrong.
p282_297|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p282_298|There were no passengers on board.
p282_299|It could work.
p282_300|This is a war over our home.
p282_301|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p282_302|There's no evidence he was ever there.
p282_303|You should be.
p282_304|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p282_305|The letters are going out today.
p282_306|Is there on his hands?
p282_307|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p282_308|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p282_309|She is very distinctive.
p282_310|We have got to get the points from this one.
p282_311|You may have a short memory.
p282_312|Henman has been warned.
p282_313|We are in the end game.
p282_314|It will work.
p282_315|I came into this world with nothing.
p282_316|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p282_317|Our message was inclusive.
p282_318|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p282_319|Feel the air, the space.
p282_320|Is there a new way forward?
p282_321|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p282_322|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p282_323|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p282_324|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p282_325|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p282_326|Three years ago he would have been.
p282_327|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p282_328|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p282_329|Two people were interviewed.
p282_330|I've got no secret.
p282_331|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p282_332|This is a friendly match?
p282_333|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p282_334|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p282_335|They should take their mobile phones.
p282_336|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p282_337|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p282_338|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p282_339|She is free.
p282_340|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p282_341|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p282_342|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p282_343|Yet he left a few days later.
p282_344|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p282_345|As, indeed, they would be.
p282_346|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p282_347|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p282_348|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p282_349|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p282_350|That would help.
p283_001|Please call Stella.
p283_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p283_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p283_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p283_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p283_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p283_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p283_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p283_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p283_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p283_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p283_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p283_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p283_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p283_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p283_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p283_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p283_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p283_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p283_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p283_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p283_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p283_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p283_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p283_025|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p283_026|We are a service industry.
p283_027|It's not going to work out that way.
p283_028|The idea is not new.
p283_029|Because we do not need it.
p283_030|And we have a singer.
p283_031|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p283_032|We speak about the performance.
p283_033|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
p283_034|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p283_035|It could well be the case.
p283_036|It is not for any other purpose.
p283_037|That means an extra two years.
p283_038|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p283_039|He is believed to live in Britain.
p283_040|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p283_041|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p283_042|The boy is no longer with us.
p283_043|There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
p283_044|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p283_045|Among them are many criminals.
p283_046|I was released after six days.
p283_047|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p283_048|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p283_049|No details of the talks were given.
p283_050|Clearly, they had other problems.
p283_051|It also opened a branch in Livingston.
p283_052|I would say the position is open.
p283_053|That was the theory, anyway.
p283_054|I had come back from London.
p283_055|I was inspired by two things.
p283_056|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p283_057|There was no safety net.
p283_058|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p283_059|How are you, sir ?
p283_060|So is that it, then ?
p283_061|Do I have a favourite ?
p283_062|What do we do ?
p283_063|He also presented You Bet!
p283_064|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
p283_065|I expect a rapid response.
p283_066|We felt it was sufficient.
p283_067|This is the year of the Tiger.
p283_068|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p283_069|We believe a third party was involved.
p283_070|The Government should be ashamed.
p283_071|There's still plenty time left.
p283_072|You do not change overnight.
p283_073|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p283_074|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p283_075|We will pay their bills.
p283_076|He is a young man with a new deal.
p283_077|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p283_078|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p283_079|It is very special for me.
p283_080|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p283_081|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p283_082|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p283_083|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p283_084|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p283_085|The result is a vacuum.
p283_086|It looks like a hit.
p283_087|I'd like to see the business case.
p283_088|It makes for an interesting conference.
p283_089|I've had it for the exams.
p283_090|You have to respect the office.
p283_091|He has been a success this year.
p283_092|By then, he was walking on water.
p283_093|We have to offer value for money.
p283_094|It's so hard to shift.
p283_095|They lived for their children.
p283_096|Potions said he would drive.
p283_097|The trick is to try it.
p283_098|Little is known about them.
p283_099|However, it did not end that way.
p283_100|It really was an unusual award.
p283_101|IT has been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
p283_102|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p283_103|We could not get any possession.
p283_104|That is the important thing.
p283_105|Why do it otherwise ?
p283_106|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p283_107|So, did she meet him ?
p283_108|So what is the campaign about ?
p283_109|And does it ?
p283_110|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p283_111|It's good to have a voice.
p283_112|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p283_113|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p283_114|Their attitude is all wrong.
p283_115|We made a world record together.
p283_116|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p283_117|It's for that reason he should resign.
p283_118|There were no grounds for his action.
p283_119|It's been a long wait.
p283_120|There is no credible official announcement.
p283_121|Our house was very small.
p283_122|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p283_123|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p283_124|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p283_125|Sport is good for you.
p283_126|It was won on the issue of the land.
p283_127|I am a committed European.
p283_128|From it emerged a cup.
p283_129|That was the first step.
p283_130|That might help a bit.
p283_131|It is a delight on every level.
p283_132|We would make a start.
p283_133|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p283_134|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p283_135|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p283_136|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p283_137|This should begin in October.
p283_138|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p283_139|We did what we had to do.
p283_140|If not, a deal could take many months.
p283_141|But it is different in different regions.
p283_142|Last night, the row continued.
p283_143|You've got to be vigilant.
p283_144|Glasgow is a friendly city.
p283_145|We are entirely happy with Russell.
p283_146|It's not a U-turn at all.
p283_147|And I have some advice for my old friend.
p283_148|He was a home referee.
p283_149|Before it was an ordeal.
p283_150|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
p283_151|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p283_152|I'm so grateful for that.
p283_153|It will be retained as part of the group.
p283_154|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p283_155|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p283_156|I am just trying to do my job.
p283_157|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p283_158|It has become a way of life.
p283_159|I was caught out a little bit.
p283_160|This will secure the future of our industry.
p283_161|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p283_162|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p283_163|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p283_164|What happened in that game ?
p283_165|Are you going to win ?
p283_166|Was it the wife ?
p283_167|Why change it ?
p283_168|What do we want to do that for ?
p283_169|It has to be an event.
p283_170|Three hours later, the man was free.
p283_171|We have a clean bill of health.
p283_172|It was by the numbers.
p283_173|Today I had no failures in my team.
p283_174|My Dad is a hero.
p283_175|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p283_176|He was asked to quit.
p283_177|There is no reason at all.
p283_178|The woman was his wife.
p283_179|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p283_180|They should stop the bombing.
p283_181|The research was my life.
p283_182|I'd love to be like Peter.
p283_183|The suspension of the head teacher has been lifted.
p283_184|I am a good player.
p283_185|He was in great spirits.
p283_186|It's never great to finish second.
p283_187|We have a budget in March.
p283_188|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p283_189|Nobody did in those days.
p283_190|Well, this article is a bit like that.
p283_191|It's nice to be nice.
p283_192|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p283_193|There was no hint of scandal.
p283_194|It was to be inclusive.
p283_195|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p283_196|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p283_197|The expansion will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
p283_198|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p283_199|The hotel was now for sale.
p283_200|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p283_201|Does the name matter ?
p283_202|how do you get it back ?
p283_203|What are you not good at ?
p283_204|I think, therefore I am ?
p283_205|Who was she ?
p283_206|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p283_207|They receive a high profile in the media.
p283_208|They bought the property four years ago.
p283_209|She was married with one son.
p283_210|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p283_211|A copy of the report will be sent to the them.
p283_212|We are not making any comment.
p283_213|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p283_214|He lives in a neighbouring village.
p283_215|It was a bit like having children.
p283_216|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p283_217|I will work on her.
p283_218|We represent a wide range of society.
p283_219|We always felt we could win.
p283_220|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p283_221|They are still very quiet.
p283_222|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p283_223|I came home by ambulance.
p283_224|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p283_225|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p283_226|You could feel the heat.
p283_227|I suggest a new plan.
p283_228|That is the real test.
p283_229|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p283_230|The early physical reports were clear.
p283_231|Consumers have the right to choose.
p283_232|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p283_233|This is a holy place.
p283_234|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p283_235|This will take several weeks.
p283_236|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p283_237|We have an election in eight days.
p283_238|January is a bad time of year.
p283_239|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p283_240|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p283_241|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p283_242|I had relied on him.
p283_243|I'm just a regular person.
p283_244|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p283_245|It was a great experience.
p283_246|His second was a beauty.
p283_247|These will take a little time to develop.
p283_248|There's a chance they might come down.
p283_249|This is an exciting time for the party.
p283_250|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p283_251|The problem was you thought you were a big man.
p283_252|It was a crazy day.
p283_253|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p283_254|Our future is in their hands.
p283_255|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p283_256|It could be to do with the location.
p283_257|We played them off the pitch.
p283_258|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p283_259|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p283_260|At the time, he was a living legend.
p283_261|My wife and family are the support system.
p283_262|They have not been in touch with the club.
p283_263|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
p283_264|She claimed the day was for young people.
p283_265|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p283_266|It had so much to do with output.
p283_267|She died in middle age.
p283_268|And they were being paid ?
p283_269|was everything done to save people ?
p283_270|What was the matter for concern ?
p283_271|Do I think about them often ?
p283_272|Is it in the right place ?
p283_273|Did he trip ?
p283_274|That takes a lot of courage.
p283_275|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
p283_276|The irony was not lost.
p283_277|I would do away with the dress code.
p283_278|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p283_279|The minister is the engineer.
p283_280|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p283_281|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p283_282|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p283_283|Nato was not a love affair.
p283_284|You can never tell with the manager.
p283_285|We need to establish the facts.
p283_286|Persuaded to change his mind.
p283_287|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
p283_288|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p283_289|My son was too young to die.
p283_290|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
p283_291|I should think so, too.
p283_292|My office is down there.
p283_293|None of the agencies was able to help.
p283_294|I told you I was ill.
p283_295|We accept the new rules.
p283_296|He looked like a schoolboy.
p283_297|They are very keen to work with us.
p283_298|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p283_299|The next month is very important.
p283_300|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p283_301|This is a total mystery.
p283_302|At first I thought I was gone.
p283_303|It is the end of an adventure.
p283_304|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p283_305|It looks as though he will be right.
p283_306|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
p283_307|It was an easy decision to come here.
p283_308|The target is to break even by Christmas.
p283_309|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p283_310|My whole life has changed.
p283_311|It was never a free kick.
p283_312|It further expressed his defiance.
p283_313|He said he was sorry.
p283_314|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
p283_315|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p283_316|We have to be very, very careful.
p283_317|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p283_318|If not, he should go home.
p283_319|He is well respected by his colleagues.
p283_320|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p283_321|This is the correct decision.
p283_322|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p283_323|The Project is far from that.
p283_324|What form did that take ?
p283_326|What are they for ?
p283_327|Is there a waiting list ?
p283_328|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p283_329|So what happens next ?
p283_330|He will address the nation this evening.
p283_331|The attacker died in the crash.
p283_332|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p283_333|No final decision has been taken.
p283_334|In Europe, it is always over two games.
p283_335|I was there five months ago.
p283_336|Well, he can do it.
p283_337|The songs are just so good.
p283_338|And it's a goodbye from him.
p283_339|We need to increase the membership.
p283_340|A new school will be built.
p283_341|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p283_342|The capital costs are modest.
p283_343|It became a book by itself.
p283_344|Cast Away now on general release.
p283_345|Like many companies, it is a problem.
p283_346|The party lasted all night.
p283_347|But I think it's different from the rest!
p283_348|It is a matter of clarity.
p283_349|He did that every night I was with him.
p283_350|They come to enjoy themselves.
p283_351|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p283_352|Another reason is a shortage of stock.
p283_353|And he goes with it.
p283_354|My life is exactly the same.
p283_356|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p283_357|We want to play at the worlds.
p283_358|We will listen to any suggestion.
p283_359|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p283_360|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p283_361|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p283_362|In the old days, it was easy.
p283_363|They were impressive against France.
p283_364|The airport was even different.
p283_365|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
p283_366|He was at school in Devon.
p283_367|I'd like to take the plunge.
p283_368|I have a moral dilemma.
p283_369|Last weekend he was awful.
p283_370|There is a range of employers.
p283_371|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p283_372|Ferguson is a good example.
p283_373|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p283_374|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p283_375|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
p283_376|It should be a great game, though.
p283_377|I said she was very young.
p283_378|He had no previous convictions.
p283_379|He was then replaced by Ross.
p283_380|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p283_381|Had this been common practice ?
p283_382|What do they want us to do ?
p283_383|Is it worth it ?
p283_384|Does it matter ?
p283_385|That can be good for us.
p283_386|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p283_387|But the main issue will be the sale of Burger King.
p283_388|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p283_389|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p283_390|It's as wide as a church in here.
p283_391|It would be quite nice.
p283_392|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p283_393|The pair are very much in love.
p283_394|As, indeed, they would be.
p283_395|He has an equity stake in the investment house.
p283_396|This is a club on the rise.
p283_397|We came across the first set of bodies.
p283_398|Theatre is not a museum.
p283_399|It has only been rumours.
p283_400|Final proposals will be published in February.
p283_401|I could not live with it.
p283_402|The death rates are still as high.
p283_403|A review is under way.
p283_404|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p283_405|There is a lack of logic.
p283_406|That investment has now been secured.
p283_407|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p283_408|It proved a good decision.
p283_409|Colour was at the core of his life.
p283_410|The BBC was a disgrace.
p283_411|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p283_412|But the foundations have been laid.
p283_413|I was Scottish on the basis of my family.
p283_414|I was shaking on the blocks.
p283_415|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
p283_416|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p283_417|The second goal was superb.
p283_418|That's all I can say.
p283_419|How do you take them away ?
p283_420|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p283_421|After the match, do you ?
p283_422|I am astonished at attack.
p283_423|I was pleased with my own game.
p283_424|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p283_425|Yet the data is compelling.
p283_426|No date has been set for a meeting.
p283_427|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p283_428|That is a personal matter.
p283_429|I'm pleased about one thing.
p283_430|My aim is a top six finish.
p283_431|These guys are looking for business.
p283_432|He is on the wrong side.
p283_433|I would rather look at him.
p283_434|It needs to be volatile.
p283_435|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p283_436|It is based on a true story.
p283_437|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p283_438|Being with me is an honour.
p283_439|He will be judged by his actions.
p283_440|Which may be the same thing.
p283_441|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p283_442|We shall not forget him.
p283_443|I can almost pretend to be Scottish.
p283_444|Everything in golf is a balance.
p283_445|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
p283_446|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p283_447|Something has got to give.
p283_448|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
p283_449|If we were offered The Scotsman I would buy it.
p283_450|We went straight into the bedroom.
p283_451|I do not see it as some kind of reward.
p284_001|Please call Stella.
p284_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p284_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p284_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p284_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p284_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p284_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p284_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p284_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p284_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p284_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p284_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p284_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p284_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p284_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p284_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p284_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p284_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p284_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p284_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p284_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p284_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p284_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p284_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.
p284_025|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p284_026|We will be homeless.
p284_027|Is this accurate?
p284_028|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p284_029|They have no history.
p284_030|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p284_031|I'd just like to play.
p284_032|There's a story, too.
p284_033|This is the window.
p284_034|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p284_035|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p284_036|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p284_037|It's a fact.
p284_038|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p284_039|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p284_040|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p284_041|Dancing was her life.
p284_042|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p284_043|We will push.
p284_044|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p284_045|Among them are many criminals.
p284_046|It is marvellous.
p284_047|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p284_048|Our people are ready.
p284_049|Here's a clue.
p284_050|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p284_051|I was inspired by two things.
p284_052|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p284_053|My fitness was very poor.
p284_054|Sadly, it can't.
p284_055|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p284_056|I expect a rapid response.
p284_057|What was the main difference?
p284_058|There's a danger.
p284_059|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p284_060|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p284_061|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p284_062|It's that kind of place.
p284_063|They are real.
p284_064|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p284_065|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p284_066|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p284_067|That was a gold medal for certain.
p284_068|We should have known.
p284_069|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p284_070|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p284_071|He was at home with his pals.
p284_072|It was magic.
p284_073|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p284_074|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p284_075|Is there a new way forward?
p284_076|The party is up for it.
p284_077|Even the one she loved.
p284_078|People must remain vigilant.
p284_079|Today she has been released.
p284_080|Who will pay for this?
p284_081|He had taken everything from me.
p284_082|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p284_083|By then, he was walking on water.
p284_084|They lived for their children.
p284_085|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p284_086|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p284_087|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p284_088|It is a lifeline.
p284_089|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p284_090|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p284_091|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p284_092|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p284_093|Then came the crunch.
p284_094|It is annoying.
p284_095|I love the Dome.
p284_096|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p284_097|I am extremely sad.
p284_098|It is a love affair.
p284_099|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p284_100|May not have been at fault?
p284_101|They tried to deny it.
p284_102|They make a selective perception process.
p284_103|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p284_104|That's all right then.
p284_105|Oil embargo endorsed.
p284_106|Before the game we went for a pint.
p284_107|She reflects a bit.
p284_108|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p284_109|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p284_110|It was a funny game.
p284_111|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p284_112|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p284_113|It was the eighties.
p284_114|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p284_115|It is so sad.
p284_116|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p284_117|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p284_118|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p284_119|It is rubbish.
p284_120|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p284_121|We enjoyed it today.
p284_122|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p284_123|There were no grounds for his action.
p284_124|I can't even get into the A team.
p284_125|She really suffered for her art.
p284_126|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p284_127|The people will come.
p284_128|No production was achieved.
p284_129|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p284_130|It plans to return to this field.
p284_131|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p284_132|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p284_133|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p284_134|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p284_135|I don't know the full story.
p284_136|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p284_137|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p284_138|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p284_139|I was awful.
p284_140|The idea is simple.
p284_141|That group reported just before Christmas.
p284_142|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p284_143|It is not just about pay.
p284_144|Note the date.
p284_145|So I got a blood test.
p284_146|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p284_147|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p284_148|The weather forecast isn't good.
p284_149|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p284_150|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p284_151|I was on a roll.
p284_152|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p284_153|We are on a four-year mission.
p284_154|My Dad is a hero.
p284_155|He was asked to quit.
p284_156|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p284_157|He can do no wrong.
p284_158|Was this element always there?
p284_159|These days are long gone.
p284_160|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p284_161|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p284_162|They are not advertised.
p284_163|Seven people were later detained by police.
p284_164|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p284_165|Again, we were lucky.
p284_166|They will do their own thing.
p284_167|Does that put pressure on us?
p284_168|One season, they might do well.
p284_169|Is Saddam a threat?
p284_170|As we worked.
p284_171|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p284_172|It is not either national standards or local control.
p284_173|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p284_174|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p284_175|Everyone can be bought.
p284_176|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p284_177|I've been there.
p284_178|Four policemen were wounded.
p284_179|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p284_180|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p284_181|What has caused the demise of singing?
p284_182|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p284_183|Our team is just so young.
p284_184|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p284_185|It is a farce.
p284_186|Peace was won.
p284_187|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p284_188|I came home by ambulance.
p284_189|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p284_190|Is that success?
p284_191|They are ready.
p284_192|I have a cold.
p284_193|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p284_194|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p284_195|It's all about money, money, money.
p284_196|There was no safety net.
p284_197|It was worth a photograph.
p284_198|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p284_199|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p284_200|There was an e-mail.
p284_201|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p284_202|I am delighted for Simon.
p284_203|It had all been arranged.
p284_204|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p284_205|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p284_206|It's not ideal.
p284_207|In each case they were a goal down.
p284_208|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p284_209|I might come back.
p284_210|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p284_211|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p284_212|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p284_213|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p284_214|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p284_215|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p284_216|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p284_217|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p284_218|It's not before time.
p284_219|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p284_220|The report is due out next month.
p284_221|But she was.
p284_222|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p284_223|My wife and family are the support system.
p284_224|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
p284_225|We were awful.
p284_226|They tried to give her advice.
p284_227|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p284_228|The parties have been given until today to respond.
p284_229|There is no excuse.
p284_230|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p284_231|But it's a subtle process.
p284_232|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p284_233|The car was just there.
p284_234|The whole thing will be great.
p284_235|Our policy is clear.
p284_236|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p284_237|You can feel at home in China.
p284_238|The scene is about this?
p284_239|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p284_240|It was a kind of contempt.
p284_241|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p284_242|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p284_243|I should think so, too.
p284_244|It was a hit.
p284_245|There's the mix.
p284_246|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p284_247|Is there on his hands?
p284_248|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p284_249|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p284_250|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p284_251|Chelsea was a great club.
p284_252|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p284_253|We have to expand.
p284_254|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p284_255|Is that a serious question?
p284_256|They must play for each other.
p284_257|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p284_258|There's not much money in cycling.
p284_259|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p284_260|I am just trying to do my job.
p284_261|This is a question of Islam.
p284_262|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p284_263|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p284_264|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p284_265|The system can work.
p284_266|We're in shock.
p284_267|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p284_268|It's a way of life.
p284_269|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p284_270|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p284_271|They seem to get away with it.
p284_272|She looked so young.
p284_273|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p284_274|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p284_275|If not, he should go home.
p284_276|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p284_277|We are a grandmother.
p284_278|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p284_279|You feel very helpless.
p284_280|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p284_281|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p284_282|He will address the nation this evening.
p284_283|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p284_284|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p284_285|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p284_286|This is a national crisis.
p284_287|Bombing slaughter rejected
p284_288|We are not going to forget.
p284_289|No Briton has ever won.
p284_290|Painful, but only because it's true.
p284_291|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p284_292|The songs are just so good.
p284_293|And it's a goodbye from him.
p284_294|The goals will come.
p284_295|Who can predict?
p284_296|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p284_297|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p284_298|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p284_299|I was the sheep.
p284_300|What has altered?
p284_301|Nothing is safe.
p284_302|One was a lawyer.
p284_303|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p284_304|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p284_305|They are wrong.
p284_306|I can live with it.
p284_307|Work has started.
p284_308|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p284_309|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p284_310|You should be.
p284_311|The minister is the engineer.
p284_312|The letters are going out today.
p284_313|We want to play at the worlds.
p284_314|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p284_315|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p284_316|Special measures were needed.
p284_317|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p284_318|The show is at an end.
p284_319|Your father was a good man.
p284_320|Such actions are rarely popular.
p284_321|We have got to get the points from this one.
p284_322|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p284_323|Henman has been warned.
p284_324|I would love it.
p284_325|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
p284_326|The problems began a long time ago.
p284_327|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p284_328|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p284_329|We are in the end game.
p284_330|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p284_331|There was no time scale.
p284_332|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p284_333|It is a job creation scheme.
p284_334|Relief was beyond belief.
p284_335|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p284_336|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p284_337|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p284_338|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p284_339|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p284_340|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p284_341|He was the architect.
p284_342|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p284_343|He has to learn.
p284_344|Two people were interviewed.
p284_345|I've got no secret.
p284_346|This is a big advantage.
p284_347|I'm very lucky.
p284_348|A great deal has been achieved.
p284_349|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p284_350|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p284_351|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p284_352|They should take their mobile phones.
p284_353|Eight months later, he was dead.
p284_354|I HAVE a dream.
p284_355|We have big ideas.
p284_356|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p284_357|I first met him last summer.
p284_358|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p284_359|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p284_360|She is free.
p284_361|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p284_362|Yet he left a few days later.
p284_363|The pair are very much in love.
p284_364|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p284_365|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p284_366|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p284_367|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p284_368|There was a substantial explosion.
p284_369|Their time has gone.
p284_370|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p284_371|They believed it worked.
p284_372|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p284_373|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p284_374|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p284_375|They have not done so this season so far.
p284_376|It is a simple equation.
p284_377|Clark is back on top form.
p284_378|There is no signature.
p284_379|The task is enormous.
p284_380|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p284_381|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p284_382|It is hard to understand.
p284_383|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p284_384|I was lost.
p284_385|Something is wrong.
p284_386|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p284_387|That's the name of the game, though.
p284_388|It's like a car crash.
p284_389|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p284_390|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p284_391|You had to go and see him.
p284_392|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p284_393|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p284_394|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p284_395|We try to keep it right.
p284_396|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p284_397|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p284_398|It can help.
p284_399|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p284_400|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p284_401|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p284_402|But we are a young side.
p284_403|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p284_404|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p284_405|It will take place in July.
p285_001|Please call Stella.
p285_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p285_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p285_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p285_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p285_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p285_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p285_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p285_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p285_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p285_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p285_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p285_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p285_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p285_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p285_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p285_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p285_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p285_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p285_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p285_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p285_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p285_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p285_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p285_025|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p285_026|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p285_027|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p285_028|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p285_029|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p285_030|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p285_031|There's a story, too.
p285_032|This is the window.
p285_033|He was jailed for five years.
p285_034|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p285_035|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p285_036|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p285_037|They're just different.
p285_038|It was clear.
p285_039|Indeed, he does.
p285_040|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p285_041|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p285_042|Sure, it's funny.
p285_043|This represents a tough game for us.
p285_044|Is a drug dealer?
p285_045|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p285_046|He looks like an Afghan.
p285_047|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p285_048|Here's a clue.
p285_049|I was lost.
p285_050|It's a miracle.
p285_051|I love the Dome.
p285_052|There was no safety net.
p285_053|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p285_054|That's the truth.
p285_055|We will treat it like a World Cup match.
p285_056|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p285_057|Scotland had great assets.
p285_058|It's that kind of place.
p285_059|They are real.
p285_060|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p285_061|We should have known.
p285_062|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p285_063|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p285_064|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p285_065|There could be a way back.
p285_066|The death rates are still as high.
p285_067|I had my suspicions.
p285_068|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p285_069|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p285_070|Even the one she loved.
p285_071|It's now down in black and white.
p285_072|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p285_073|What has changed?
p285_074|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p285_075|He is in the queue.
p285_076|He is driven.
p285_077|All options are open.
p285_078|I was too young.
p285_079|Someone who cares
p285_080|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p285_081|It is a blow.
p285_082|They lived for their children.
p285_083|It will be tight.
p285_084|This is the start of our season.
p285_085|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p285_086|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p285_087|We knew they could do it.
p285_088|But I was wrong.
p285_089|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p285_090|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p285_091|I saw the whole thing.
p285_092|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p285_093|It was mayhem.
p285_094|Journalists should make him.
p285_095|It is a love affair.
p285_096|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p285_097|They tried to deny it.
p285_098|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p285_099|No, the equipment is extra.
p285_100|We have an election in eight days.
p285_101|Oil embargo endorsed.
p285_102|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p285_103|She reflects a bit.
p285_104|It was an interesting thing to do.
p285_105|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p285_106|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p285_107|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p285_108|Is that right?
p285_109|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p285_110|It was the eighties.
p285_111|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p285_112|It is so sad.
p285_113|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p285_114|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p285_115|It is rubbish.
p285_116|Who would be a referee?
p285_117|We enjoyed it today.
p285_118|She does not want to speak.
p285_119|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p285_120|There were no grounds for his action.
p285_121|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p285_122|She really suffered for her art.
p285_123|It is not a U-turn.
p285_124|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p285_125|No production was achieved.
p285_126|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p285_127|I am now unemployed.
p285_128|We work well together.
p285_129|It's not true.
p285_130|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p285_131|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p285_132|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p285_133|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p285_134|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p285_135|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p285_136|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p285_137|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p285_138|Who would be right?
p285_139|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p285_140|I was awful.
p285_141|That group reported just before Christmas.
p285_142|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p285_143|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p285_144|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p285_145|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p285_146|The weather forecast isn't good.
p285_147|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p285_148|I was on a roll.
p285_149|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p285_150|We are on a four-year mission.
p285_151|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p285_152|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p285_153|My Dad is a hero.
p285_154|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p285_155|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p285_156|That includes the equipment?
p285_157|Well, he should know.
p285_158|I will tell you.
p285_159|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p285_160|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p285_161|As, indeed, they would be.
p285_162|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p285_163|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p285_164|They are not advertised.
p285_165|Tell it like it was?
p285_166|Seven people were later detained by police.
p285_167|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p285_168|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p285_169|I carried on for him.
p285_170|He was a crazy man.
p285_171|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p285_172|One season, they might do well.
p285_173|As we worked.
p285_174|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p285_175|It is not either national standards or local control.
p285_176|My players are special.
p285_177|I drove the ball well.
p285_178|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p285_179|The goals were good.
p285_180|His name was unknown.
p285_181|Nothing is safe.
p285_182|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p285_183|Many innocent people will die.
p285_184|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p285_185|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p285_186|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p285_187|What has caused the demise of singing?
p285_188|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p285_189|There is no openness.
p285_190|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p285_191|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p285_192|It caused a lot of upset.
p285_193|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p285_194|It's a fact.
p285_195|I came home by ambulance.
p285_196|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p285_197|We live by the rule of law.
p285_198|The service from the other players was super.
p285_199|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p285_200|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p285_201|Today was first class.
p285_202|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p285_203|I don't want to use it.
p285_204|There was an e-mail.
p285_205|He knows a lot.
p285_206|Twaddle is a case in point.
p285_207|It's not before time.
p285_208|It's not ideal.
p285_209|We want to keep the pound.
p285_210|In each case they were a goal down.
p285_211|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p285_212|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p285_213|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p285_214|People should make their own decisions.
p285_215|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p285_216|Because they didn't want to know.
p285_217|That has been the easy part.
p285_218|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p285_219|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p285_220|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p285_221|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
p285_222|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p285_223|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p285_224|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p285_225|But she was.
p285_226|At the time, he was a living legend.
p285_227|My wife and family are the support system.
p285_228|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p285_229|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p285_230|They tried to give her advice.
p285_231|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p285_232|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p285_233|Wealth is relative.
p285_234|You should be.
p285_235|It's quite nice.
p285_236|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p285_237|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p285_238|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p285_239|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p285_240|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p285_241|If we lose the doctor it would be the last straw.
p285_242|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p285_243|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p285_244|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p285_245|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p285_246|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p285_247|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p285_248|It was a hit.
p285_249|There's the mix.
p285_250|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p285_251|The concerns are the same.
p285_252|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p285_253|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p285_254|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p285_255|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p285_256|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p285_257|Is that a serious question?
p285_258|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p285_259|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p285_260|There's not much money in cycling.
p285_261|Souter will be back.
p285_262|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p285_263|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p285_264|He was also married with two children.
p285_265|The system can work.
p285_266|We are happy.
p285_267|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p285_268|We're in shock.
p285_269|Of course I was tempted.
p285_270|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p285_271|It was very fast.
p285_272|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p285_273|They seem to get away with it.
p285_274|I feel pretty good.
p285_275|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p285_276|She looked so young.
p285_277|It's so awful.
p285_278|He looked very sharp.
p285_279|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p285_280|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p285_281|He will address the nation this evening.
p285_282|Yet, it worked.
p285_283|Who will perform?
p285_284|It was good.
p285_285|Who did the recruiting?
p285_286|We are not going to forget.
p285_287|No Briton has ever won.
p285_288|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p285_289|Who can predict?
p285_290|There was a vacuum.
p285_291|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p285_292|He was at home with his pals.
p285_293|What has altered?
p285_294|I was brought up in a mining background.
p285_295|She is really magic.
p285_296|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p285_297|One was a lawyer.
p285_298|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p285_299|They are wrong.
p285_300|It could work.
p285_301|This is a war over our home.
p285_302|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p285_303|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p285_304|It needs a team approach.
p285_305|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p285_306|There is no excuse.
p285_307|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p285_308|The letters are going out today.
p285_309|She is very distinctive.
p285_310|We are a peaceful people.
p285_311|Hartley should know.
p285_312|Henman has been warned.
p285_313|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
p285_314|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p285_315|A review is under way.
p285_316|It will work.
p285_317|I came into this world with nothing.
p285_318|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p285_319|Off with their heads.
p285_320|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p285_321|There was no time scale.
p285_322|Our message was inclusive.
p285_323|Either team will be hard.
p285_324|It's not long enough.
p285_325|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p285_326|He scored a touchdown.
p285_327|The party is up for it.
p285_328|The outcome is not in doubt.
p285_329|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p285_330|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p285_331|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p285_332|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p285_333|Three years ago he would have been.
p285_334|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p285_335|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p285_336|I've got no secret.
p285_337|went on sale.
p285_338|I'm very lucky.
p285_339|Our policy is clear.
p285_340|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p285_341|I will miss him.
p285_342|They should take their mobile phones.
p285_343|I got a yellow card.
p285_344|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p285_345|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p285_346|I HAVE a dream.
p285_347|There may be reasons for it.
p285_348|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p285_349|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p285_350|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p285_351|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p285_352|The pair are very much in love.
p285_353|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p285_354|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p285_355|We will be homeless.
p285_356|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p285_357|It is a memorial.
p285_358|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p285_359|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p285_360|This is a club on the rise.
p285_361|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p285_362|They believed it worked.
p285_363|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p285_364|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p285_365|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p285_366|It seems a long time ago.
p285_367|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p285_368|So there, we won.
p285_369|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p285_370|There is no signature.
p285_371|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p285_372|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p285_373|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p285_374|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
p285_375|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p285_376|Something is wrong.
p285_377|It will be an exciting finale to the season without a doubt.
p285_378|You can cope with it.
p285_379|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p285_380|At the last I found a bunker.
p285_381|It is the old story.
p285_382|Yet the data is compelling.
p285_383|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p286_001|Please call Stella.
p286_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p286_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p286_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p286_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p286_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p286_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p286_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p286_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p286_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p286_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p286_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p286_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p286_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p286_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p286_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p286_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p286_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p286_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p286_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p286_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p286_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p286_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p286_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p286_025|Smoking is also very important.
p286_026|We must convince the citizens.
p286_027|I am pretty careful with money.
p286_028|Because we do not need it.
p286_029|It is about control of our economy.
p286_030|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p286_031|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p286_032|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p286_033|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
p286_034|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p286_035|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p286_036|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p286_037|Costs have got to be controlled.
p286_038|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p286_039|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p286_040|It is serious - but not that serious.
p286_041|Among them are many criminals.
p286_042|He looks like an Afghan.
p286_043|He will need that machine.
p286_044|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p286_045|I had come back from London.
p286_046|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p286_047|I had trouble with the producers.
p286_048|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p286_049|We are certainly talking about many millions.
p286_050|We are a new department.
p286_051|He also presented You Bet!
p286_052|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p286_053|How are you, sir ?
p286_054|So is that it, then ?
p286_055|Do I have a favourite ?
p286_056|People come to see the Highlands.
p286_057|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
p286_058|We have not given up hope.
p286_059|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p286_060|We would have concerns about suspension.
p286_061|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p286_062|We have to keep our clients.
p286_063|It seems to have worked.
p286_064|They have to come up with a solution.
p286_065|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p286_066|It is a great feeling right now.
p286_067|It's not covered by the insurance.
p286_068|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p286_069|It wasn't possible to relax.
p286_070|We speak about the performance.
p286_071|Then followed a bout of flu.
p286_072|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p286_073|That would be too easy.
p286_074|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p286_075|It is a job creation scheme.
p286_076|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p286_077|Even the one she loved.
p286_078|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p286_079|Their mandate is to target inflation.
p286_080|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p286_081|It's all going to clear the debt.
p286_082|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p286_083|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p286_084|He has been a success this year.
p286_085|The error appeared in a warrant.
p286_086|We have to offer value for money.
p286_087|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p286_088|It's so hard to shift.
p286_089|Potions said he would drive.
p286_090|Theatre is not a museum.
p286_091|Why do it otherwise ?
p286_092|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p286_093|So, did she meet him ?
p286_094|So what is the campaign about ?
p286_095|And does it ?
p286_096|Are you from the rugby ?
p286_097|Had I heard ?
p286_098|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p286_099|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p286_100|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p286_101|It really was an unusual award.
p286_102|I cannot believe this decision.
p286_103|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p286_104|Until you hit the big games.
p286_105|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p286_106|We will deal with the refugees.
p286_107|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p286_108|We could not get any possession.
p286_109|They must be on commission.
p286_110|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p286_111|It's not a holiday time for football players.
p286_112|He was forced to quit.
p286_113|But I know the course.
p286_114|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p286_115|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
p286_116|In the end we made too many errors.
p286_117|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p286_118|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p286_119|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.
p286_120|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p286_121|It is an impressive record.
p286_122|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p286_123|I have learned from him.
p286_124|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p286_125|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
p286_126|Maybe this battle has been.
p286_127|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p286_128|It isn't a happy memory.
p286_129|The firm also has a construction division.
p286_130|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
p286_131|Then again, we could have.
p286_132|They will remember this victory for a while.
p286_133|Structural changes were also required.
p286_134|It was a good game to watch.
p286_135|His job was not advertised.
p286_136|However, the problem is the timing.
p286_137|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p286_138|Which can happen any time.
p286_139|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p286_140|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p286_141|My life has changed a lot.
p286_142|He said to give a local injection.
p286_143|The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
p286_144|The first half was depressing.
p286_145|Tiger is not the norm.
p286_146|He will get his chances.
p286_147|They could use a boost.
p286_148|What happened in that game ?
p286_149|Are you going to win ?
p286_150|Was it the wife ?
p286_151|Why change it ?
p286_152|What do we want to do that for ?
p286_153|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
p286_154|Anyone can do the sums.
p286_155|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
p286_156|He's not a Celtic man.
p286_157|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p286_158|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p286_159|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p286_160|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p286_161|Behind him was his brother.
p286_162|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p286_163|The family kept away from me.
p286_164|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p286_165|We will turn the corner.
p286_166|My Dad is a hero.
p286_167|It should never have happened.
p286_168|We did what we had to do.
p286_169|The bank was now involved.
p286_170|Full back was a bit of the unknown.
p286_171|It's never great to finish second.
p286_172|Adventure is the champagne of life.
p286_173|That would open the gates of hell.
p286_174|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p286_175|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p286_176|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p286_177|They could not match it.
p286_178|One season, they might do well.
p286_179|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p286_180|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p286_181|People should not become complacent.
p286_182|This championship is different from the other majors.
p286_183|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p286_184|I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
p286_185|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p286_186|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p286_187|Each case is treated on merit.
p286_188|We have a long way to go this week.
p286_189|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.

p286_191|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p286_192|They are only interested in attacking Labour.
p286_193|They need to look after themselves.
p286_194|Miller was every bit as happy.
p286_195|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p286_196|I cannot say too much about them.
p286_197|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p286_198|The new owners wanted the club to go in a different direction.
p286_199|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p286_200|I'm interested in interesting work.
p286_201|We represent a wide range of society.
p286_202|It caused a lot of upset.
p286_203|Does the name matter ?
p286_204|how do you get it back ?
p286_205|What are you not good at ?
p286_206|I think, therefore I am ?
p286_207|Who was she ?
p286_208|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p286_209|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p286_210|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p286_211|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p286_212|Because he was born in England.
p286_213|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p286_214|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p286_215|It was a moment of madness.
p286_216|This will be our new beginning.
p286_217|They have the cash and the fire power.
p286_218|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p286_219|We should all be grateful.
p286_220|The early physical reports were clear.
p286_221|The result is utterly compelling.
p286_222|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p286_223|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p286_224|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p286_225|This will take several weeks.
p286_226|Scotland will play its part.
p286_227|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p286_228|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p286_229|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p286_230|His injury was completely random.
p286_231|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
p286_232|It will affect their work.
p286_233|These things have not happened by accident.
p286_234|They are difficult awards to decide.
p286_235|I am considered a teenager.
p286_236|He must get to know himself.
p286_237|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
p286_238|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.

p286_243|I have spoken to the skipper.
p286_244|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
p286_245|The scientific debate is dead.
p286_246|This would include the GM food industry.
p286_247|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p286_248|They are the innocent victims.
p286_249|She will attend in July.
p286_250|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
p286_251|She claimed the day was for young people.
p286_252|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p286_253|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p286_254|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
p286_255|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p286_256|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p286_257|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p286_258|There were no reports of casualties.
p286_259|This fact is supported by audience research.
p286_260|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p286_261|And it was this one.
p286_262|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p286_263|Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
p286_264|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p286_265|We have no information on Iraq.
p286_266|His is a global perspective.
p286_267|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p286_268|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p286_269|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p286_270|I should think so, too.
p286_271|No production contract is yet in sight.
p286_272|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p286_273|The capital costs are modest.
p286_274|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p286_275|This idea has been around for four years.
p286_276|And they were being paid ?
p286_277|was everything done to save people ?
p286_278|What was the matter for concern ?
p286_279|Do I think about them often ?
p286_280|Is it in the right place ?
p286_281|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p286_282|That will be a problem for later.
p286_283|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p286_284|They must play for each other.
p286_285|These figures are truly terrible.
p286_286|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
p286_287|There's not much money in cycling.
p286_288|The stage was set for a showdown.
p286_289|It wasn't about one player.
p286_290|That view has not altered.
p286_291|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
p286_292|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p286_293|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p286_294|It was an easy decision to come here.
p286_295|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p286_296|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p286_297|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p286_298|Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
p286_299|That has been described in some quarters as nonsense and arrogance.
p286_300|You have to expect this type of thing.
p286_301|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p286_302|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p286_303|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p286_304|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p286_305|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p286_306|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p286_307|It was simply no contest.
p286_308|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p286_309|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p286_310|But it has been an amazing experience.
p286_311|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p286_312|Our season is not finished.
p286_313|The rescue package is public money.
p286_314|The effect was almost magical.
p286_315|I was there five months ago.
p286_316|I am a retailer by nature.
p286_317|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
p286_318|Holland won by five wickets.
p286_319|It's unlikely to be renewed.
p286_320|He has taken the title for the last two years.
p286_321|The songs are just so good.
p286_322|I must do something about it.
p286_323|We need to increase the membership.
p286_324|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p286_325|They can go to no other method of fishing.
p286_326|You are a different people.
p286_327|McNaughton was not so sure.
p286_328|The dealer is on notice.
p286_329|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p286_330|It is a road of death.
p286_331|Investors can be forgiven for caution.
p286_332|The party lasted all night.
p286_333|Much the same thing happens in a young company.
p286_334|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p286_335|Six other people were injured.
p286_336|And he goes with it.
p286_337|Survival is not an option.
p286_338|The letters are going out today.
p286_339|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p286_340|I didn't have the reply.
p286_341|The actor has met with Mandela.
p286_342|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p286_343|My body is clearly capable.
p286_344|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p286_345|Other musicians were found in retirement.
p286_346|It is a terrible state of affairs.
p286_347|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p286_348|Is our children learning ?
p286_349|What form did that take ?
p286_350|Are they free ?
p286_351|Is there a waiting list ?
p286_352|They were impressive against France.
p286_353|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p286_354|It was a terrible combination of factors.
p286_355|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
p286_356|Whether this return was too soon.
p286_357|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p286_358|The pain is still acute.
p286_359|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p286_360|I'd like to take the plunge.
p286_361|I have a moral dilemma.
p286_362|My view has now completely changed.
p286_363|We have very limited capacity.
p286_364|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p286_365|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
p286_366|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
p286_367|I think we'll just keep it.
p286_368|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p286_369|Do not forget about Monaco.
p286_370|You did not see it.
p286_371|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p286_372|I was delighted to accept.
p286_373|Neither woman has been named.
p286_374|You need a licence to run a pub.
p286_375|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p286_376|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
p286_377|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p286_378|Finally came the moment of truth.
p286_379|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p286_380|It's as wide as a church in here.
p286_381|She is obviously very disappointed.
p286_382|It is not for any other purpose.
p286_383|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p286_384|The team hadn't been picked.
p286_385|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p286_386|One-third of the places are already taken.
p286_387|The marshall at the turn was great.
p286_388|That time may never be broken.
p286_389|The director will be present.
p286_390|Rugby has an extended run.
p286_391|Is it worth it ?
p286_392|Does it matter ?
p286_393|How do you take them away ?
p286_394|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p286_395|After the match, do you ?
p286_396|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p286_397|It gets into the culture.
p286_398|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p286_399|In fact, he was great today.
p286_400|A review is under way.
p286_401|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p286_402|Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
p286_403|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p286_404|Well, the big day has arrived.
p286_405|Clark is back on top form.
p286_406|The choice is strictly personal.
p286_407|It's too close to call.
p286_408|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
p286_409|They were a lovely family.
p286_410|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p286_411|I've had a wonderful career.
p286_412|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p286_413|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p286_414|It's just a training thing.
p286_415|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p286_416|Three years ago he would have been.
p286_417|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
p286_418|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
p286_419|It had been on the cards.
p286_420|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p286_421|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
p286_422|That was a touch of class.
p286_423|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p286_424|It was important to win the singles.
p286_425|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p286_426|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p286_427|No date has been fixed for his return.
p286_428|It was a breathtaking moment.
p286_429|I never had a childhood.
p286_430|Nobody should believe this story.
p286_431|It's going to be epic.
p286_432|They did the right thing.
p286_433|There is another important factor.
p286_434|The growth potential is enormous.
p286_435|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
p286_436|But he gave no details.
p286_437|That was a great performance by the team.
p286_438|Which may be the same thing.
p286_439|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
p286_440|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p286_441|Everything in golf is a balance.
p286_442|It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
p286_443|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p286_444|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p286_445|There were no formal announcements.
p286_446|He had no problems with discipline.
p286_447|Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.
p286_448|The couple had one daughter.
p287_001|Please call Stella.
p287_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p287_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p287_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p287_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p287_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p287_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p287_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p287_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p287_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p287_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p287_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p287_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p287_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p287_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p287_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p287_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p287_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p287_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p287_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p287_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p287_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p287_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p287_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p287_025|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p287_026|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p287_027|Meetings will also remain private.
p287_028|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p287_029|He has the courage of the unaware.
p287_030|Life was like a timetable.
p287_031|This is a central issue.
p287_032|But a solution has been found.
p287_033|I thought it was an accident.
p287_034|President Bush is at war.
p287_035|That period was a struggle.
p287_036|This represents a tough game for us.
p287_037|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p287_038|Among them are many criminals.
p287_039|But it might have done.
p287_040|There is no reason at all.
p287_041|This will get their attention.
p287_042|Must be prepared to use it.
p287_043|He will need that machine.
p287_044|I had come back from London.
p287_045|I saw them last week.
p287_046|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p287_047|There was no safety net.
p287_048|The teacher would have approved.
p287_049|It is quite a figure.
p287_050|We have to look beyond the very short term.
p287_051|It depends on the couple.
p287_052|I expect a rapid response.
p287_053|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p287_054|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p287_055|You do not change overnight.
p287_056|We will pay their bills.
p287_057|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p287_058|How are you, sir ?
p287_059|So is that it, then ?
p287_060|Do I have a favourite ?
p287_061|What do we do ?
p287_062|It has been an amazing day.
p287_063|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p287_064|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p287_065|This is a big step up.
p287_066|There can be no compromise on welfare.
p287_067|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p287_068|Now the plot is perfect.
p287_069|That would be too easy.
p287_070|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p287_071|It looks like a hit.
p287_072|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p287_073|I first met him last summer.
p287_074|We did it for the jersey.
p287_075|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p287_076|By then, he was walking on water.
p287_077|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p287_078|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
p287_079|That was a great performance by the team.
p287_080|It was a total disaster.
p287_081|I've never seen anything like it.
p287_082|He added that he felt undermined.
p287_083|It was not an insult.
p287_084|In each case they were a goal down.
p287_085|It was clear on Thursday.
p287_086|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p287_087|FOR once, you should believe the hype.
p287_088|But I know the course.
p287_089|We intend to change the model.
p287_090|Two of the team became ill.
p287_091|No, the equipment is extra.
p287_092|This decision is a farce.
p287_093|Before the game we went for a pint.
p287_094|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
p287_095|It would be the end of farming.
p287_096|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p287_097|It's not a lack of confidence.
p287_098|We have got a race.
p287_099|He will go on the bench.
p287_100|You had better believe it.
p287_101|New Year will be very busy.
p287_102|There's still plenty time left.
p287_103|That was the first step.
p287_104|I was impressed with them.
p287_105|Such actions are rarely popular.
p287_106|Mr Blair should be warned.
p287_107|Why do it otherwise ?
p287_108|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p287_109|So, did she meet him ?
p287_110|So what is the campaign about ?
p287_111|And does it ?
p287_112|Then again, we could have.
p287_113|There were no grounds for his action.
p287_114|We have a training class.
p287_115|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p287_116|We did what we had to do.
p287_117|They made such decisions in London.
p287_118|She was also very brave.
p287_119|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p287_120|You are a gambling man.
p287_121|My conscience is not clear.
p287_122|He is a great addition to our team.
p287_123|I felt he was excellent.
p287_124|We will try to find someone.
p287_125|The money needs to go to the front line.
p287_126|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
p287_127|I miss the freedom that I had.
p287_128|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
p287_129|We had to add value.
p287_130|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p287_131|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
p287_132|That is the real test.
p287_133|I would relish the prospect.
p287_134|It has become a way of life.
p287_135|We will provide immediate access.
p287_136|It will clearly be discussed in cabinet.
p287_137|Three hours later, the man was free.
p287_138|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p287_139|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p287_140|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p287_141|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p287_142|It would seem a natural progression.
p287_143|We will turn the corner.
p287_144|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p287_145|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p287_146|The strong pound also took its toll.
p287_147|These days are long gone.
p287_148|I am a good player.
p287_149|That shows the strength of the US Tour.
p287_150|We have a budget in March.
p287_151|The pension levels will remain the same.
p287_152|You had to go and see him.
p287_153|They could not match it.
p287_154|The people are the hero.
p287_155|Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
p287_156|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
p287_157|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p287_158|This much I can tell you.
p287_159|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p287_160|Phase one was a shambles.
p287_161|The hotel was now for sale.
p287_162|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p287_163|Tomorrow is a new day.
p287_164|What happened in that game ?
p287_165|Are you going to win ?
p287_166|Was it the wife ?
p287_167|Why change it ?
p287_168|What do we want to do that for ?
p287_169|His son is a local legend.
p287_170|I am not ready to walk away.
p287_171|Says the Duke of York.
p287_172|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p287_173|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p287_174|They bought the property four years ago.
p287_175|They need to look after themselves.
p287_176|He is believed to live in Britain.
p287_177|People like to talk about these things.
p287_178|Being investor ready is a good start.
p287_179|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p287_180|We've had great things in the past.
p287_181|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p287_182|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
p287_183|You know the sort of thing.
p287_184|They were seriously after him.
p287_185|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p287_186|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p287_187|It caused a lot of upset.
p287_188|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p287_189|Last night was a key episode.
p287_190|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p287_191|It is hard to tell.
p287_192|I can't play the game for them.
p287_193|I was inspired by two things.
p287_194|They might be surprised by the response.
p287_195|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p287_196|This will be our new beginning.
p287_197|The service from the other players was super.
p287_198|However, it is not as simple as this.
p287_199|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p287_200|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p287_201|Getting this right is essential.
p287_202|Does the name matter ?
p287_203|how do you get it back ?
p287_204|What are you not good at ?
p287_205|I think, therefore I am ?
p287_206|Who was she ?
p287_207|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p287_208|From there, they can go anywhere.
p287_209|I had relied on him.
p287_210|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p287_211|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
p287_212|It had all been arranged.
p287_213|His third goal was superb.
p287_214|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p287_215|His second was a beauty.
p287_216|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p287_217|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p287_218|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p287_219|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p287_220|The red card was okay.
p287_221|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p287_222|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p287_223|It will now take over the running of the estate.
p287_224|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p287_225|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
p287_226|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
p287_227|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p287_228|We have learned a tremendous amount.
p287_229|She died in middle age.
p287_230|And thought we would get away with it.
p287_231|We were a load of rubbish.
p287_232|The trust was unable to pay the fourth interim dividend.
p287_233|This is a family club.
p287_234|They need to win a trophy.
p287_235|I was ready for this.
p287_236|I am still waiting for a reply.
p287_237|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p287_238|My future is in the marathon.
p287_239|The effects are not all bad.
p287_240|He would not impose a fine.
p287_241|It was a fairy tale.
p287_242|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p287_243|She took them for a term.
p287_244|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p287_245|But that's another story for another day.
p287_246|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
p287_247|Persuaded to change his mind.
p287_248|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p287_249|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p287_250|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p287_251|I should think so, too.
p287_252|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p287_253|No production contract is yet in sight.
p287_254|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p287_255|That you can do it.
p287_256|He was on a horse.
p287_257|The concerns are the same.
p287_258|We are in a war.
p287_259|It is not enough to be first division champions.
p287_260|We run within the law.
p287_261|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p287_262|They are very keen to work with us.
p287_263|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p287_264|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p287_265|They must play for each other.
p287_266|It is also very valuable.
p287_267|There's not much money in cycling.
p287_268|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p287_269|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p287_270|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p287_271|This is a question of Islam.
p287_272|And they were being paid ?
p287_273|was everything done to save people ?
p287_274|What was the matter for concern ?
p287_275|Do I think about them often ?
p287_276|Is it in the right place ?
p287_277|Did he trip ?
p287_278|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
p287_279|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
p287_280|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p287_281|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p287_282|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p287_283|It was an easy decision to come here.
p287_284|And Michael was just great.
p287_285|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p287_286|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p287_287|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
p287_288|It was never a free kick.
p287_289|She failed in her action.
p287_290|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p287_291|We have to be very, very careful.
p287_292|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p287_293|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p287_294|If not, he should go home.
p287_295|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p287_296|Size is not the issue.
p287_297|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p287_298|But it is up again.
p287_299|The rescue package is public money.
p287_300|Either team will be hard.
p287_301|That is the general feeling.
p287_302|It has to be an event.
p287_303|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p287_304|We can work all night.
p287_305|The answer is with ourselves.
p287_306|Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott appealed for privacy.
p287_307|There is no evidence for that.
p287_308|I can hardly believe it.
p287_309|Nothing has been put into action.
p287_310|You are a different people.
p287_311|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p287_312|This will secure the future of our industry.
p287_313|They are not left wing.
p287_314|McNaughton was not so sure.
p287_315|I was brought up in a mining background.
p287_316|The City welcomed the numbers.
p287_317|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p287_318|This is a war over our home.
p287_319|We have a good healthy debate.
p287_320|And he goes with it.
p287_321|I have signed a contract.
p287_322|It is a court case.
p287_323|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p287_324|Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
p287_325|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p287_326|After some discussion they did.
p287_327|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p287_328|It wasn't a good day for us.
p287_329|The show is at an end.
p287_330|What form did that take ?
p287_331|Are they free ?
p287_332|What are they for ?
p287_333|Is there a waiting list ?
p287_334|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p287_335|So what happens next ?
p287_336|It was an achievement all right.
p287_337|My whole life has changed.
p287_338|We are a peaceful people.
p287_339|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p287_340|You may have a short memory.
p287_341|The problems began a long time ago.
p287_342|A Home Office spokesman said.
p287_343|In the old days, it was easy.
p287_344|I think it's about time.
p287_345|The airport was even different.
p287_346|Other people had looked at it.
p287_347|They are now out in the cold.
p287_348|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
p287_349|It is a strong case.
p287_350|My view has now completely changed.
p287_351|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p287_352|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p287_353|It's wonderful to have won.
p287_354|He was then replaced by Ross.
p287_355|I'd like to take the plunge.
p287_356|Appointments should be made on merit.
p287_357|I have a moral dilemma.
p287_358|Even the one she loved.
p287_359|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p287_360|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p287_361|They were the acts of men.
p287_362|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p287_363|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p287_364|Three years ago he would have been.
p287_365|He did a good job.
p287_366|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p287_367|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p287_368|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
p287_369|It is a stroke of genius.
p287_370|The members have voted against it.
p287_371|We knew he was very creative.
p287_372|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p287_373|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p287_374|They should take their mobile phones.
p287_375|SE is well down that road.
p287_376|The hill farm is owned by the father of the young man.
p287_377|There is a cup final at stake.
p287_378|It's only a matter of scale.
p287_379|I do not like to lose.
p287_380|There is no deal as yet.
p287_381|It's as wide as a church in here.
p287_382|This remains the party's policy.
p287_383|They will fight for everything.
p287_384|The pair are very much in love.
p287_385|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p287_386|It was like a vacuum.
p287_387|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p287_388|My dad is all right.
p287_389|It gets into the culture.
p287_390|There was a substantial explosion.
p287_391|But we are very near.
p287_392|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p287_393|It has only been rumours.
p287_394|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p287_395|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p287_396|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p287_397|Safety was also an issue.
p287_398|Had this been common practice ?
p287_399|What do they want us to do ?
p287_400|Is it worth it ?
p287_401|Does it matter ?
p287_402|Motion described it as a unique event.
p287_403|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p287_404|No, because it was too many.
p288_001|Please call Stella.
p288_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p288_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p288_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p288_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p288_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p288_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p288_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p288_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p288_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p288_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p288_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p288_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p288_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p288_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p288_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p288_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p288_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p288_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p288_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p288_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p288_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p288_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p288_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p288_025|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p288_026|It is a disaster area.
p288_027|Is this accurate?
p288_028|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p288_029|Because we do not need it.
p288_030|I was an athlete.
p288_031|It is a case of taking a risk.
p288_032|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p288_033|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
p288_034|It was fit for royalty.
p288_035|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p288_036|President Bush is at war.
p288_037|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p288_038|I was scared.
p288_039|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p288_040|But it took a lot of bottle.
p288_041|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p288_042|We need to chat.
p288_043|But it might have done.
p288_044|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p288_045|He is too weak to move.
p288_046|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p288_047|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p288_048|It will come all right.
p288_049|I was lost.
p288_050|I guess I was lucky, though.
p288_051|I was inspired by two things.
p288_052|Sadly, it can't.
p288_053|It's very odd.
p288_054|It is unique.
p288_055|It will take time.
p288_056|That's the truth.
p288_057|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p288_058|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p288_059|Four other charges were dropped.
p288_060|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p288_061|They're appalled by that.
p288_062|Scotland had great assets.
p288_063|Equity declined to comment.
p288_064|We should have known.
p288_065|The end result is precisely the same.
p288_066|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p288_067|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p288_068|That was the easy election.
p288_069|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p288_070|Neither it is.
p288_071|He seemed to lose his focus.
p288_072|It can be halted.
p288_073|It was chaotic.
p288_074|Is there a new way forward?
p288_075|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p288_076|I've not thought about it.
p288_077|People must remain vigilant.
p288_078|This is the way things should be handled.
p288_079|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p288_080|It's all going to clear the debt.
p288_081|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p288_082|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p288_083|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p288_084|We have other options.
p288_085|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p288_086|By then, he was walking on water.
p288_087|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p288_088|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p288_089|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p288_090|It is a lifeline.
p288_091|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p288_092|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p288_093|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p288_094|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p288_095|Journalists should make him.
p288_096|It was a good performance.
p288_097|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p288_098|I didn't play well last year.
p288_099|It was an adventure.
p288_100|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p288_101|I'm not depressed.
p288_102|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p288_103|It's in his blood.
p288_104|It had been played at festivals.
p288_105|We do not expect any surplus.
p288_106|It is so sad.
p288_107|They were behind the wheel.
p288_108|The fire was above the hole.
p288_109|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p288_110|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p288_111|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p288_112|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p288_113|It is rubbish.
p288_114|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p288_115|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p288_116|That's all right then.
p288_117|There were no grounds for his action.
p288_118|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p288_119|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p288_120|I'm so angry.
p288_121|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p288_122|So the European elections are extremely important.
p288_123|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p288_124|Well, you can have a tree.
p288_125|I had relied on him.
p288_126|You've got to be vigilant.
p288_127|The goals were good.
p288_128|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p288_129|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p288_130|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p288_131|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p288_132|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p288_133|Is that Titanic?
p288_134|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p288_135|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p288_136|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p288_137|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p288_138|He should have won.
p288_139|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p288_140|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p288_141|The weather forecast isn't good.
p288_142|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p288_143|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p288_144|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p288_145|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p288_146|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
p288_147|They were later discharged from hospital.
p288_148|This latter point is hugely important.
p288_149|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p288_150|It was so new, so exciting.
p288_151|I'm just enjoying every match.
p288_152|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p288_153|It has to be now.
p288_154|I was in the train station overnight.
p288_155|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p288_156|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p288_157|I have got a wife to feed.
p288_158|It is not too late to get on board.
p288_159|They will do their own thing.
p288_160|Does that put pressure on us?
p288_161|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p288_162|It is too much for me.
p288_163|It is a terrible place.
p288_164|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p288_165|Nobody did in those days.
p288_166|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p288_167|He was a crazy man.
p288_168|They thought they had found a home.
p288_169|The jury is still out.
p288_170|It's quite a routine.
p288_171|It should be easy.
p288_172|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p288_173|Tony had arrived.
p288_174|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p288_175|There is no point in looking any further.
p288_176|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p288_177|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p288_178|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
p288_179|It's a joke.
p288_180|It just came into my head that day.
p288_181|They really did a great job.
p288_182|It is tough, but possible.
p288_183|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p288_184|People will ask about us.
p288_185|If the director is with you.
p288_186|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p288_187|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p288_188|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p288_189|Peace was won.
p288_190|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p288_191|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p288_192|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p288_193|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p288_194|The conference is the first test.
p288_195|Is that success?
p288_196|But we are not immune to the problem.
p288_197|They are in the euro.
p288_198|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p288_199|But she might be.
p288_200|It's all about money, money, money.
p288_201|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p288_202|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p288_203|Now, it's all right.
p288_204|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p288_205|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p288_206|Feel the heat?
p288_207|She should not be blamed.
p288_208|Twaddle is a case in point.
p288_209|It had all been arranged.
p288_210|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p288_211|In each case they were a goal down.
p288_212|I was so nervous.
p288_213|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p288_214|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p288_215|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p288_216|Who was on the panel?
p288_217|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p288_218|We've got the bronze.
p288_219|Mental health is a massive issue.
p288_220|You have to do your research.
p288_221|We played them off the pitch.
p288_222|But it will be sorted out this week.
p288_223|It was good fun.
p288_224|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p288_225|I'd never seen a play about me.
p288_226|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p288_227|The track is currently covered in snow.
p288_228|The body follows the mind.
p288_229|However, no further action was taken by police.
p288_230|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p288_231|It is set in Paris.
p288_232|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p288_233|I haven't made the donation yet.
p288_234|And a film maker was born.
p288_235|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p288_236|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p288_237|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p288_238|He's got to go.
p288_239|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p288_240|It's too much work.
p288_241|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p288_242|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p288_243|It is hard won.
p288_244|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p288_245|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p288_246|He's a lovely young man.
p288_247|A friendship that will endure.
p288_248|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p288_249|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p288_250|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p288_251|I told you I was ill.
p288_252|It's a source of deep concern.
p288_253|This is a big club.
p288_254|It is very important that we get the balance right.
p288_255|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p288_256|I was happily surprised.
p288_257|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p288_258|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p288_259|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p288_260|Blood samples were taken.
p288_261|We shall rely on human beings.
p288_262|This is a question of Islam.
p288_263|It looks as though he will be right.
p288_264|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p288_265|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p288_266|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p288_267|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p288_268|And Michael was just great.
p288_269|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p288_270|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p288_271|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p288_272|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p288_273|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p288_274|I am an estate agent.
p288_275|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p288_276|It happens from time to time.
p288_277|But I've won both ways.
p288_278|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p288_279|You've got to have both sides.
p288_280|He will address the nation this evening.
p288_281|The attacker died in the crash.
p288_282|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p288_283|Who will perform?
p288_284|It's like a high school play.
p288_285|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p288_286|This is a national crisis.
p288_287|The death toll included five children.
p288_288|Who did the recruiting?
p288_289|So I did.
p288_290|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p288_291|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p288_292|Who can predict?
p288_293|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p288_294|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p288_295|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p288_296|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p288_297|The home was now under new management.
p288_298|I thought it was my only chance.
p288_299|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p288_300|Nothing is safe.
p288_301|One was a lawyer.
p288_302|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p288_303|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p288_304|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p288_305|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p288_306|It's just not funny!
p288_307|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p288_308|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p288_309|It's certainly different.
p288_310|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p288_311|We want to play at the worlds.
p288_312|He was solid.
p288_313|This is the culture change in medicine.
p288_314|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p288_315|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p288_316|I never thought it would take this long.
p288_317|My whole life has changed.
p288_318|They wanted the club to make money.
p288_319|Hartley should know.
p288_320|Kids are terrible.
p288_321|The home team had an amazing start.
p288_322|My body is clearly capable.
p288_323|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p288_324|I had my suspicions.
p288_325|However, the groups denied the claims.
p288_326|There was some merit in that.
p288_327|I came into this world with nothing.
p288_328|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p288_329|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p288_330|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p288_331|We agreed to disagree.
p288_332|He was then replaced by Ross.
p288_333|Donald was his friend.
p288_334|I'd like to take the plunge.
p288_335|She did not attend the courtroom.
p288_336|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p288_337|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p288_338|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p288_339|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p288_340|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p288_341|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p288_342|These days are long gone.
p288_343|He's been the key to everything.
p288_344|The boat was fantastic.
p288_345|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p288_346|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p288_347|It was good for us that they lost that day.
p288_348|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p288_349|You need a licence to run a pub.
p288_350|That has been lost.
p288_351|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p288_352|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p288_353|It's good to start with Judith.
p288_354|There is no room for error.
p288_355|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p288_356|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p288_357|He's very explosive.
p288_358|We have to move forward.
p288_359|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p288_360|However, it was well worth the wait.
p288_361|Our numbers are small.
p288_362|That would help.
p288_363|So I left.
p288_364|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p288_365|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p288_366|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p288_367|I am a star.
p288_368|Not so, it seems.
p288_369|Who was the mystery MP?
p288_370|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p288_371|The play is based on a real-life event.
p288_372|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p288_373|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p288_374|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p288_375|We do not get that impression now.
p288_376|They play together perfectly.
p288_377|It was a funny game.
p288_378|It is a large number.
p288_379|I am a wealthy person.
p288_380|Colour was at the core of his life.
p288_381|I know I'm in a very special position.
p288_382|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p288_383|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p288_384|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p288_385|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
p288_386|There is a solution, she believes.
p288_387|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p288_388|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p288_389|It's just outrageous.
p288_390|It's like a basketball.
p288_391|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p288_392|He is on the wrong side.
p292_001|Please call Stella.
p292_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p292_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p292_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p292_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p292_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p292_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p292_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p292_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p292_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p292_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p292_025|I was not involved in these discussions.
p292_026|O, Is he conscious?
p292_027|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p292_028|They are being deported from their homes.
p292_029|IT IS the last week of rehearsals.
p292_030|I thought the game was very poor.
p292_031|Three days later, he was killed.
p292_032|I don't expect to be here tomorrow.
p292_033|Or it's not really for us, if you like.
p292_034|It was a deceit.
p292_035|You are in power.
p292_036|PR will be just one of them.
p292_037|Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
p292_038|It is just like the stock market.
p292_039|And the newspapers were full of it.
p292_040|I wish the solutions were as easy.
p292_041|She does not see anything ever changing.
p292_042|It doesn't come any better than this.
p292_043|Mr Blair should be warned.
p292_044|The idea has potential for the future.
p292_045|I did not concentrate on my performance.
p292_046|That was not due to me.
p292_047|Structural changes were also required.
p292_048|We suffered a lot for seven years.
p292_049|The racist abuse was terrible.
p292_050|What is the new religion?
p292_051|Five officers were injured.
p292_052|It was all for good reason as well.
p292_053|Fewer people are being killed in accidents.
p292_054|I'm trying not to think about that.
p292_055|Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
p292_056|I find the whole affair disturbing.
p292_057|One woman refused to sit down.
p292_058|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p292_059|I was completely knackered.
p292_060|There are two interests in this woodland.
p292_061|A killer is also on the loose.
p292_062|Last night, the row continued.
p292_063|Our approach will be different.
p292_064|You can see how he made his money.
p292_065|It's really good, as long as we play well.
p292_066|We would certainly consider the proposals.
p292_067|We tend to come good at the end.
p292_068|His record with England was not good.
p292_069|Lose, and they would be ridiculed.
p292_070|Three penalties were given.
p292_071|I didn't think they would be that stupid.
p292_072|He was between people and God.
p292_073|We are just being flooded.
p292_074|We could easily have lost that game.
p292_075|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p292_076|There were no proposals on the table.
p292_077|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p292_078|THERE's only one word for it.
p292_079|It was very full anyway.
p292_080|That was him under pressure.
p292_081|I can't believe she is dead.
p292_082|I was in prison for a year.
p292_083|Among them is his beloved teacher.
p292_084|He had a really frustrating time last year.
p292_085|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p292_086|I am constantly changing my mind.
p292_087|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p292_088|Ending a tenancy is a last resort.
p292_089|But he just carried on anyway.
p292_090|We should be capable of managing it, though.
p292_091|It was that kind of afternoon.
p292_092|His presence was very important.
p292_093|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
p292_094|He insisted that his staff were too.
p292_095|They should come clean.
p292_096|Let's see that increase over the years.
p292_097|That, though, is an old story.
p292_098|The real issue is personal.
p292_099|Life becomes a song.
p292_100|It's about time something was done about equipment.
p292_101|I've learned from my mistakes.
p292_102|So far this season this approach is working.
p292_103|I have got a knife.
p292_104|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p292_105|What did we learn?
p292_106|On that basis, he would set it aside.
p292_107|That, however, is the end of the good news.
p292_108|Seven people were later detained by police.
p292_109|It's nice to be involved.
p292_110|There could still be some to come forward.
p292_111|What are they like?
p292_112|They were back in favour with the SAC.
p292_113|The squad is too small.
p292_114|Together they will attempt to express the whole.
p292_115|I'm just going to do my best.
p292_116|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
p292_117|They offered to make an investment into it.
p292_118|We have no knowledge of this.
p292_119|I was influenced by all of these things.
p292_120|Is my wife a racist?
p292_121|This would not be my first choice.
p292_122|It certainly should not be used too often.
p292_123|They will run a mile.
p292_124|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p292_125|Britain has never had it so good.
p292_126|We are under no illusions about this.
p292_127|But the killer remains at large.
p292_128|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p292_129|He is adamant that he is innocent.
p292_130|I had a train to catch.
p292_131|It is a terrible loss.
p292_132|What's happening to her?
p292_133|It was even worse than at home.
p292_134|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
p292_135|The plane was in flames
p292_136|We cannot lose it.
p292_137|I still think he will win.
p292_138|Elections would follow in about two years.
p292_139|However, this idea is never developed.
p292_140|I've got to get on with my career.
p292_141|It is a road of death.
p292_142|Now we look forward to it.
p292_143|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p292_144|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p292_145|I have a great respect for her.
p292_146|I suggest a new plan.
p292_147|IT takes the biscuit.
p292_148|But we are not immune to the problem.
p292_149|You're not going to forget something like that.
p292_150|They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
p292_151|The result is utterly compelling.
p292_152|This is the root of their problems.
p292_153|Other forces were, however, at work.
p292_154|He also has property interests in the country.
p292_155|That takes time and games and practice.
p292_156|If only the acting profession was that simple.
p292_157|It is a new company for Scotland.
p292_158|We should have gone solo.
p292_159|We don't even know his name.
p292_160|They have known the hard times.
p292_161|It is about the script for me.
p292_162|You cannot enter the clubhouse.
p292_163|The president will not be removed from office.
p292_164|These are serious matters.
p292_165|Are you all right at the front?
p292_166|We want to replicate that success.
p292_167|It was the first time they met.
p292_168|It's been a good year.
p292_169|I was never alone with her, right?
p292_170|That will be vital.
p292_171|It's a technical demand.
p292_172|It's just a normal life.
p292_173|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
p292_174|This is a very high price.
p292_175|He is the example for all of us.
p292_176|There is no way to do this.
p292_177|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p292_178|Only one person can claim the credit.
p292_179|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
p292_180|O Neill has delivered.
p292_181|But there was no going back.
p292_182|We will reform the welfare state.
p292_183|Progress is being made but it is slow.
p292_184|We didn't think anything would happen.
p292_185|He had come of age.
p292_186|We were a shambles at the back.
p292_187|It's not before time.
p292_188|One of these problems is the railways.
p292_189|It is a very sad day.
p292_190|A crucial moment has arrived.
p292_191|I have nothing to hide.
p292_192|Next time round, it will be different.
p292_193|How can they get one?
p292_194|Only local people are helping.
p292_195|We had to work hard for it.
p292_196|John Lennon is a very large industry.
p292_197|This is my homeland.
p292_198|You saw the pain he was in.
p292_199|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p292_200|Drugs are always an issue.
p292_201|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p292_202|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p292_203|It has affected me.
p292_204|She made no further comment.
p292_205|I have no conflict with them.
p292_206|The next one comes up.
p292_207|She was close to suicide at one stage.
p292_208|We've got better players here.
p292_209|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p292_210|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p292_211|People have no chance of getting out.
p292_212|I am appalled by this news.
p292_213|We were extremely arrogant.
p292_214|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
p292_215|I was just getting over the time difference.
p292_216|I am proud of moments like that.
p292_217|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p292_218|No-one expected that their parents would stay.
p292_219|We're looking for unity in the council.
p292_220|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p292_221|You cannot allow it to go on.
p292_222|It's up to the defence team.
p292_223|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p292_224|No means testing will be required.
p292_225|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p292_226|I don't think that's very fair.
p292_227|He was on a horse.
p292_228|Human beings are always the same.
p292_229|Then there's the problem of sympathy.
p292_230|If only he knew himself.
p292_231|This action could have been avoided.
p292_232|I watched a game.
p292_233|Anyone else can apply.
p292_234|It was like the old days.
p292_235|This was never a support group.
p292_236|The first time you read a play.
p292_237|I was a little surprised.
p292_238|This is my home town.
p292_239|That was six years ago.
p292_240|Nothing can bring back their son.
p292_241|It is up to us to approve it.
p292_242|His musicals were very much of their time.
p292_243|They might well be right.
p292_244|There is great demand for human cloning.
p292_245|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p292_246|It starts to get you down.
p292_247|We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
p292_248|My life has been turned upside down.
p292_249|The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
p292_250|I have played well the past two days.
p292_251|I said, What was that about?
p292_252|This could prove a problem.
p292_253|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p292_254|His game was complete.
p292_255|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
p292_256|This is too much like Scotland.
p292_257|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p292_258|That goes back a long way.
p292_259|I wouldn't have had the abandon.
p292_260|They were not at the property yesterday.
p292_261|We will not tolerate it.
p292_262|It should not make the same mistake again.
p292_263|They loved it and it showed.
p292_264|However, by then the damage had been done.
p292_265|As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
p292_266|Have we not been here before?
p292_267|Just what we didn't need.
p292_268|Inquiries are still in an early stage.
p292_269|It is a very beautiful city.
p292_270|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p292_271|The company reacted very, very well.
p292_272|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p292_273|The issues are very intense.
p292_274|It won't be their last.
p292_275|You've got to have both sides.
p292_276|I'll tell you honestly.
p292_277|Dialogue is the key.
p292_278|It has been only average.
p292_279|He should be worried about me.
p292_280|That never happens in real life.
p292_281|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p292_282|That was the gimmick.
p292_283|This is a national crisis.
p292_284|He has changed my life forever.
p292_285|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p292_286|In Europe, it is always over two games.
p292_287|There's a tremendous amount of adventure.
p292_288|However, we had no failures in our side.
p292_289|This is his first movie.
p292_290|He already had had complaints.
p292_291|For that much we must be grateful.
p292_292|Spent three months alone at sea.
p292_293|They are the heroes.
p292_294|That will be the key to success.
p292_295|They are in good spirits.
p292_296|Three hours later, the man was free.
p292_297|You can't get the experience in Austria.
p292_298|I wonder if Rangers do that?
p292_299|I'm going to miss it.
p292_300|The atmosphere was excellent.
p292_301|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p292_302|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
p292_303|One was a lawyer.
p292_304|Our task is to complete the picture.
p292_305|It may have been a cry for help.
p292_306|His descent was pathetic.
p292_307|By now he was very ill with cancer.
p292_308|But let's not get carried away.
p292_309|It's only tackling congestion.
p292_310|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p292_311|We've seen that time and time again.
p292_312|Friends of the family have given their support.
p292_313|This means a great deal to the families.
p292_314|They said that they stood by their statement.
p292_315|It should be equal.
p292_316|We are on a four-year mission.
p292_317|He was always nice to me.
p292_318|Is he going to look after them?
p292_319|He had no answer.
p292_320|Scotland is too small a country for that.
p292_321|Special measures were needed.
p292_322|Your father was a good man.
p292_323|You do that because you want to win.
p292_324|The whole family was in shock.
p292_325|This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
p292_326|My whole life has changed.
p292_327|They always seem to produce.
p292_328|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p292_329|But everywhere the problems are the same.
p292_330|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p292_331|The company's in good shape.
p292_332|He became the focus of surrounding interest.
p292_333|It is out there.
p292_334|This country has many challenges.
p292_335|The best option is to destroy the plants.
p292_336|I've never had problems with any football managers.
p292_337|To begin with it looks good.
p292_338|They are with their father.
p292_339|This was a unique election.
p292_340|The review has been conducted fairly.
p292_341|They will run in tandem with New Work.
p292_342|I had to win this race.
p292_343|And right now, it isn't there.
p292_344|The boat was fantastic.
p292_345|Donald was his friend.
p292_346|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p292_347|The girls are ready to compete.
p292_348|It gives us something to work on.
p292_349|It was all too little, too late.
p292_350|What's the problem with change?
p292_351|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p292_352|There are moments of silence.
p292_353|Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
p292_354|The board of governors must act.
p292_355|That didn't happen for two reasons.
p292_356|It is time for a new approach.
p292_357|Now they have decided to have a rethink.
p292_358|Tiger is the exception.
p292_359|There's no choice is there?
p292_360|Does it, Noel?
p292_361|Do not forget about Monaco.
p292_362|You can't give in to the vandals.
p292_363|Glasgow is far from overload.
p292_364|Everything was an effort.
p292_365|And does it even matter?
p292_366|My parents are exhausted.
p292_367|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p292_368|That's why he is a national treasure.
p292_369|I'm delighted for Andy.
p292_370|And how he kept his word.
p292_371|It's their duty to protect them.
p292_372|The Cup has come home.
p292_373|This is a big, big win.
p292_374|As two candidates are proposed, a vote is taken.
p292_375|That's an equally important factor.
p292_376|We were given a break.
p292_377|It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
p292_378|That would have killed the match.
p292_379|That's not like us at all.
p292_380|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
p292_381|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p292_382|You have to rely on each other.
p292_383|Politics is a tough game.
p292_384|This season has been a nightmare.
p292_385|Everyone could see the joke.
p292_386|He is just a wonderful actor.
p292_387|Billy knew he was attracted to women.
p292_388|The occasion was a conference on Scottish art.
p292_389|Such cases are on the increase.
p292_390|This was not helpful.
p292_391|The police are not the target.
p292_392|It's a true story.
p292_393|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p292_394|But that title is a mistake.
p292_395|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
p292_396|I'd rather have been playing.
p292_397|I am immensely sad.
p292_398|Several others were absent.
p292_399|It is surprising to come back this way.
p292_400|Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
p292_401|Could they perhaps be related?
p292_402|We all thought we were going to die.
p292_403|I knew she was going to win.
p292_404|What is the Barnett formula?
p293_001|Please call Stella.
p293_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p293_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p293_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p293_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p293_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p293_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p293_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p293_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p293_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p293_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p293_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p293_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p293_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p293_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p293_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p293_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p293_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p293_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p293_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p293_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p293_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p293_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p293_025|It's not, of course, a concert hall.
p293_026|Theatre is not a museum.
p293_027|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
p293_028|All my training is for Athens.
p293_029|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p293_030|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p293_032|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p293_033|Several others were absent.
p293_034|I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
p293_035|There is a lot of heroin about.
p293_036|There is a growing anger among the group.
p293_037|I have got to adopt the same approach.
p293_038|Seven people were later detained by police.
p293_039|It's a sensible management decision.
p293_040|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p293_041|I would just like someone to confess.
p293_042|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p293_043|We can be proud of our achievements.
p293_044|Clark is back on top form.
p293_045|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p293_046|Lothian and Borders Police are also involved.
p293_047|That was the theory, anyway.
p293_048|Ferguson must take the blame.
p293_049|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p293_050|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p293_051|Stealing from the benefits system is no different.
p293_052|It is a large number.
p293_053|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p293_054|General, You didn't get a modified.
p293_055|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p293_056|That is our unfinished business.
p293_057|This is far too high.
p293_058|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p293_059|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p293_060|But the foundations have been laid.
p293_061|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p293_062|So they will settle again.
p293_063|He had other things on his mind.
p293_064|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p293_065|Let us hope so.
p293_066|It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.
p293_067|A lot of people had to wait, and people still do.
p293_068|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p293_069|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p293_070|I was shaking on the blocks.
p293_071|So the challenge is against ourselves.
p293_072|You see, my back has gone.
p293_073|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p293_074|We've had our problems at the club.
p293_075|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
p293_076|More than half of the school collapsed.
p293_077|We also hope to meet the men.
p293_078|I can live with just the one.
p293_079|All the people thought that we would die.
p293_080|Sometimes they come off.
p293_081|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p293_082|Our nation has been changed by this event.
p293_083|However, my position remains the same.
p293_084|However, it's good to turn the page.
p293_085|There are plenty examples.
p293_086|Self control is just one instalment.
p293_087|It's an hour of the same response.
p293_088|I could not believe what they were saying.
p293_089|A hard act to follow, but it is being followed.
p293_090|Will he be given time?
p293_091|Beyond that would have been outrageous.
p293_092|I seem to keep this for the majors.
p293_093|The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
p293_094|We've been overwhelmed by the response.
p293_095|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p293_096|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p293_097|It has been hijacked.
p293_098|And he's the first to see that, and say that.
p293_099|They must put them back.
p293_100|You do have a way out.
p293_101|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p293_102|This is not a European Army.
p293_103|These guys are looking for business.
p293_104|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
p293_105|I have also been delighted with Stevie.
p293_106|It was different in the endurance events.
p293_107|They will now have to justify their position.
p293_108|It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
p293_109|The objective was achieved.
p293_110|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p293_111|Look at his last couple of records.
p293_112|There is no musical background in his family.
p293_113|The cost of war is more than that.
p293_114|You, the British people, are the boss.
p293_115|The door is open.
p293_116|PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
p293_117|She doesn't know me, know anything about me.
p293_118|These are long-term investments.
p293_119|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p293_120|He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
p293_121|This is excellent news for Glasgow.
p293_122|If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
p293_123|Eriksson would have approved.
p293_124|You ask the question.
p293_125|Next league matches, Motherwell Dunfermline.
p293_126|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
p293_127|The Taliban response was swift.
p293_128|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p293_129|In fact, they should have scored three times.
p293_130|They have their own interests and techniques.
p293_131|Well, it was part of our ongoing discussions.
p293_132|The firm was down and almost out.
p293_133|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
p293_134|Fifteen minutes later, they were found.
p293_135|It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.
p293_136|That is why we are here.
p293_137|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p293_138|Somehow they got out.
p293_139|The house was so well alight.
p293_140|I've been very nervous.
p293_141|Ireland is also prepared to take in refugees.
p293_142|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p293_143|The proposals were never taken seriously.
p293_144|The Treasury denied the claims.
p293_145|The same goes for McKenna.
p293_146|Perhaps it should stay there.
p293_147|You can be sure we will have problems.
p293_148|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p293_149|We had to take action to protect them.
p293_150|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p293_151|Our policy is clear.
p293_152|I think we have a very strong case.
p293_153|Who would be out there, singing?
p293_154|It is very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
p293_155|However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
p293_156|It's something he has worked very hard on.
p293_157|Horses have some sense.
p293_158|Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
p293_159|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p293_160|The only answer is a public inquiry.
p293_161|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p293_162|However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
p293_163|Politics is a tough game.
p293_164|Darrell was, however, adamant.
p293_165|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p293_166|It is physical but it is also good.
p293_167|It's unfair on her.
p293_168|So, easy does it.
p293_169|I just want to enjoy myself.
p293_170|We are concerned that things should be safe.
p293_171|At this point we can only speculate.
p293_172|Family members are at her bedside.
p293_173|I am very shocked.
p293_174|The people here are quite reserved.
p293_175|When will this change?
p293_176|It has made me feel good.
p293_177|It's been such a long haul.
p293_178|This gives us a lot of practice.
p293_179|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
p293_180|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p293_181|However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.
p293_182|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p293_183|The crucial strike was yet to come.
p293_184|It was his job to check.
p293_185|This is the stuff of live music.
p293_186|Mrs Taylor is taking legal advice.
p293_187|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p293_188|But Allen is deadly serious.
p293_189|It's a huge amount.
p293_190|The fire was falling from the sky.
p293_191|So he was anxious to try something new.
p293_192|But he is something special, is he not?
p293_193|This is simply unjust.
p293_194|A final decision is expected by Friday.
p293_195|We will do so again.
p293_196|We will only move forward.
p293_197|I'm a bit annoyed.
p293_198|It ignores the future.
p293_199|I am just looking to God.
p293_200|I always savour the company of The Voice.
p293_201|What's the rush?
p293_202|It would also take time.
p293_203|Nothing is ruled out.
p293_204|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
p293_205|He doesn't have to like it, but he must accept it.
p293_206|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
p293_207|He was also married with two children.
p293_208|His conclusion is upbeat.
p293_209|Clearly, we could go on like this all day.
p293_210|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p293_211|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p293_212|I'm just gonna hit the shot.
p293_213|He will not be carrying out any surgery.
p293_214|The replacements made a big difference.
p293_215|We expect to come through on Thursday.
p293_216|A web site's planned for November.
p293_217|He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.
p293_218|The salary changes are long overdue.
p293_219|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
p293_220|Who would be in that desert?
p293_221|It will take some time to establish.
p293_222|Sadly the jury were not convinced.
p293_223|We never got off the bus.
p293_224|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p293_225|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p293_226|They have to come up with a solution.
p293_227|The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
p293_228|These will be finally corrected by next week.
p293_229|They will form a tribute.
p293_230|We had no idea that this letter existed.
p293_231|I think in three dimensions.
p293_232|Three others were wounded.
p293_233|They had four children together.
p293_234|It's a way of making a mark.
p293_235|There is a great carry over value.
p293_236|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p293_237|That was my own personal decision.
p293_238|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p293_239|She returned home a few days later.
p293_240|I have been here for only three months.
p293_241|So what's wrong with Scotland?
p293_242|She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
p293_243|How can they engage with the work?
p293_244|It gave me something to focus on.
p293_245|We live by the rule of law.
p293_246|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p293_247|She is fulfilled by it.
p293_248|But one shouldn't go by that.
p293_249|Nobody has been put on trial.
p293_250|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p293_251|Also, he was flawed.
p293_252|That's why he plays for Scotland.
p293_253|I just could not cope.
p293_254|They may differ on other issues.
p293_255|In short, the club was broke.
p293_256|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p293_257|There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
p293_258|That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
p293_259|I find the whole affair disturbing.
p293_260|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
p293_261|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
p293_262|The Commons is too outdated.
p293_263|It feels like a privilege.
p293_264|We have got a full house tonight.
p293_265|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
p293_266|He will be advised by me.
p293_267|It's been quite a turnaround for Miami.
p293_268|Our children are our future.
p293_269|It's part of your life.
p293_270|The defender made an impressive debut.
p293_271|I was furious about it.
p293_272|They were not doing it too well, either.
p293_273|It is typical of me.
p293_274|There are two offerings from Scotland.
p293_275|Life becomes a song.
p293_276|I know you went back this morning.
p293_277|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p293_278|This avalanche is just beginning.
p293_279|That, however, is only part of their story.
p293_280|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p293_281|I was living with my mum.
p293_282|We very much regret that it has occurred.
p293_283|The whole process was so different.
p293_284|The BBC was a disgrace.
p293_285|They feel it belongs to them.
p293_286|I don't know why she is not here.
p293_287|They certainly do not socialise.
p293_288|Police have refused to name the couple involved.
p293_289|They have got their position, we have got our position.
p293_290|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p293_291|He had played well in that central role.
p293_292|We told them in June.
p293_293|If so, we want to hear from them.
p293_294|They never gave up hope.
p293_295|Construction is due to begin in February.
p293_296|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p293_297|It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
p293_298|The red card was okay.
p293_300|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
p293_301|But they will not be compelled to join.
p293_302|It will vote with the US.
p293_303|There will be no disruption to teaching.
p293_304|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p293_305|No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.
p293_306|Again the verdict was not proven.
p293_307|We've just got to work a bit better.
p293_308|The likelihood is that it will be negative.
p293_309|That suggests that out fitness is good.
p293_310|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p293_311|Four had been brought down.
p293_312|The British public is nothing if not fickle.
p293_313|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
p293_314|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p293_315|We will build upon the basic state pension.
p293_316|Last year, however, was a different story.
p293_317|I'm confident we can turn things around.
p293_318|Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
p293_319|Frankly, they have to crack down.
p293_320|Eleven events are required.
p293_321|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p293_322|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p293_323|That's just the kind of thing we have.
p293_324|I bought a car at auction.
p293_325|You've gotten all the facts.
p293_326|It possibly depends on the position.
p293_327|Life is too short.
p293_328|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p293_329|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
p293_330|He's very young but he is growing up.
p293_331|He is in charge on the pitch.
p293_332|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p293_333|SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.
p293_334|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
p293_335|They had asked not to be named.
p293_336|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
p293_337|A whole range of factors are involved.
p293_338|There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
p293_339|They would love to do more films.
p293_340|I have great sympathy with these people.
p293_341|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p293_342|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
p293_343|It raises a serious question mark.
p293_344|He is dying from cancer.
p293_345|The package has been properly costed.
p293_346|The attitude and commitment was decent.
p293_347|The feeling is awesome.
p293_348|He quit in October.
p293_349|The family also declined to discuss the case.
p293_350|Famously, though, there was a catch.
p293_351|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p293_352|Barry will be able to handle this.
p293_354|Failure is a curious concept.
p293_355|But it can happen for Tiger.
p293_356|Patients will be partners in decision making.
p293_357|We're very excited and challenged by the project.
p293_358|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
p293_359|The initial reaction was disbelief.
p293_360|All these things have an impact.
p293_361|For some, it might not make too much difference.
p293_362|I now know that from memory.
p293_363|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p293_364|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p293_365|He doesn't even know who he is.
p293_366|This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
p293_367|Hopefully, the goals will return on Wednesday.
p293_368|The men are safe and unharmed.
p293_369|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
p293_370|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p293_371|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p293_372|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p293_373|But it was to no avail.
p293_374|I don't think the referees are against us.
p293_375|The whole experience has left me bitter.
p293_376|It is not a road of life.
p293_377|This must be kept in total perspective.
p293_378|It is three years at present.
p293_379|My husband was fighting for his life.
p293_380|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
p294_001|Please call Stella.
p294_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p294_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p294_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p294_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p294_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p294_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p294_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p294_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p294_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p294_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p294_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p294_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p294_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p294_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p294_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p294_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p294_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p294_019|Since then physicists have found that it's not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p294_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p294_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p294_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p294_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p294_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p294_025|They were the better team on the night.
p294_026|The show is sold out, like the others in the run.
p294_027|It means we have to have some patience.
p294_028|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p294_029|I was pregnant and very worried.
p294_030|He said she was mad.
p294_031|They were impressive against France.
p294_032|I am delighted at Murray's appointment.
p294_033|The airport was even different.
p294_034|Other people had looked at it.
p294_035|A neighbour said the street was shocked.
p294_036|Michael, he is running!
p294_037|He was taken to hospital, but later died.
p294_038|Their ambition is to go back.
p294_039|He got the same story.
p294_040|My view has now changed completely.
p294_041|I've been dying for an hour.
p294_042|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
p294_043|We're playing away from home and that's it.
p294_044|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p294_045|They tend to be female and retired.
p294_046|Who was the mystery MP?
p294_047|This was no accident.
p294_048|I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
p294_049|We've all done it!
p294_050|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p294_051|Hopefully, that'll come from someone on our side.
p294_052|The course record was in his name.
p294_053|But we welcome this document.
p294_054|What is the point of jailing him?
p294_055|We should not bring him into a dispute.
p294_056|This is a possible way forward.
p294_057|I am not here to get even.
p294_058|Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
p294_059|We are only human.
p294_060|I went with the mood.
p294_061|I think we'll just keep it.
p294_062|Debate is not just talk.
p294_063|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
p294_064|It is all about having physical evidence.
p294_065|People remember the Tories in office.
p294_066|What kind of inclusion is that?
p294_067|I fell in love with it right away.
p294_068|Domestic abuse is related to power and control.
p294_069|It makes for an interesting conference.
p294_070|I don't have any answer for them.
p294_071|It took about five or six hours.
p294_072|I found the course inspiring.
p294_073|Two things were clear from the new programme.
p294_074|This is the real thing now.
p294_075|Until they came to do it.
p294_076|She now lives in London.
p294_077|It will not be a long campaign.
p294_078|Subs not used, McGraw.
p294_079|Three bystanders were killed.
p294_080|One policeman was killed.
p294_081|They could not have done more for me.
p294_082|It was like a vacuum.
p294_083|That was enough for the committee.
p294_084|It is a very genuine prospect.
p294_085|It is the tip of the iceberg.
p294_086|We have to focus on what is important.
p294_087|They have to work so hard.
p294_088|It's not very pretty, but it's effective.
p294_089|Seven British members of the club are missing.
p294_090|He had just returned from a run.
p294_091|There's a strong involvement.
p294_092|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p294_093|But now it's back to golf.
p294_094|It should be a condition of employment.
p294_095|Was it a signal?
p294_096|It may not even be possible.
p294_097|In fact, they go hand in hand.
p294_098|I gave him a way out, and he took it.
p294_099|So is that it, then?
p294_100|You should have let it write the cards.
p294_101|It's annoying in a way.
p294_102|It's too close to call.
p294_103|It's a long process.
p294_104|I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
p294_105|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
p294_106|The other conditions were not specified.
p294_107|I've never felt affection for Emu.
p294_108|That's not part of the deal.
p294_109|That was the context of his remarks.
p294_110|This has gone on too long.
p294_111|We have great confidence in Derek.
p294_112|My ambition is to tell a good story.
p294_113|I don't know the nature of the illness.
p294_114|The industry will try to get round it.
p294_115|Who will deliver more service to Scotland?
p294_116|I want to make a vigorous defence.
p294_117|And she got it.
p294_118|We are the weakest link.
p294_119|We have now no choice.
p294_120|My father and mother are.
p294_121|We don't know what happened after.
p294_122|Did he just want to be on telly?
p294_123|He seems to be used to the attention.
p294_124|It's an hour of the same response.
p294_125|We have very real concerns about it.
p294_126|He has gone through the process before.
p294_127|People will see this over time.
p294_128|I can't speak for him.
p294_129|They were married in Edinburgh last summer.
p294_130|The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
p294_131|I can't see him reversing that.
p294_132|I'm deeply sorry they did.
p294_133|I can lead by example.
p294_134|I have had a wonderful career.
p294_135|It seemed to have direction.
p294_136|This takes the pressure off.
p294_137|It was different in the endurance events.
p294_138|Above all, the approach is upbeat.
p294_139|The objective was achieved.
p294_140|It was a hugely popular decision.
p294_141|He invented the language.
p294_142|Where are they?
p294_143|It's hard not to.
p294_144|It is a question of life and death.
p294_145|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p294_146|You ask the question.
p294_147|She was always a quality act.
p294_148|We are all very proud of her.
p294_149|I'm sure that is not.
p294_150|It's a great idea.
p294_151|It's like a score in some ways.
p294_152|It's a wonderful piece of water.
p294_153|Feel the air, the space.
p294_154|Therein lies the problem.
p294_155|You feel the pride.
p294_156|We are well insured.
p294_157|I was quietly confident about getting the win.
p294_158|The Treasury denied the claims.
p294_159|You've been working for four years.
p294_160|I am the Son of Sam.
p294_161|There is no shortage of commitment.
p294_162|Such as it is.
p294_163|He deserves a second chance.
p294_164|He also admitted.
p294_165|There was no change in the strategy.
p294_166|There's been a mistake.
p294_167|It had until tomorrow to comply.
p294_168|Genetic assessment is crucial.
p294_169|I enjoy my work.
p294_170|We have managed to get it under control.
p294_171|We have a genuine budget in place.
p294_172|Art is still a risky investment.
p294_173|It was little else.
p294_174|These things can happen.
p294_175|Family members are at her bedside.
p294_176|You have to go to the edges.
p294_177|I'm looking forward to facing the Irishmen.
p294_178|Harry will be up for it.
p294_179|He could tell you.
p294_180|My place is in the kitchen.
p294_181|He was, indeed, a thoroughly decent man.
p294_182|A decision is expected in September.
p294_183|It was a big departure.
p294_184|That's the name of the game, though.
p294_185|It's a huge amount.
p294_186|The fire was falling from the sky.
p294_187|I want my mum.
p294_188|This is simply unjust.
p294_189|The First Minister is an addict.
p294_190|Its role is not to interfere.
p294_191|It is becoming a bit of a habit.
p294_192|You can't believe a word.
p294_193|Something happened on that island.
p294_194|You can't get a mortgage.
p294_195|It is misleading to compare the two.
p294_196|I want a career.
p294_197|He said nothing to waiting journalists.
p294_198|O Leary was clearly disgusted.
p294_199|That's been the case for a while.
p294_200|When it is ready, it will be signed.
p294_201|All options are on the table.
p294_202|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p294_203|We now have a moment of hope.
p294_204|They should not be blamed for it.
p294_205|Our traditions and cultures remain the same.
p294_206|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
p294_207|It will take some time to establish.
p294_208|This club is perfect for me.
p294_209|And do you know, it just wasn't the same.
p294_210|This came as no great surprise to anyone.
p294_211|I love this job.
p294_212|I have no secrets.
p294_213|We are very, very pleased with the response.
p294_214|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p294_215|They will form a tribute.
p294_216|We're very, very excited.
p294_217|It's not a question of talking.
p294_218|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p294_219|Then they killed another three.
p294_220|We are not a retailer, we provide a service.
p294_221|The six others were injured.
p294_222|She has so much to offer.
p294_223|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
p294_224|It should be a pretty exciting session.
p294_225|Gas is too expensive.
p294_226|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p294_227|Are we going mainstream?
p294_228|I could not believe what they were saying.
p294_229|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p294_230|Who will run the bigger show?
p294_231|General, You didn't get a modified.
p294_232|I'm not a little girl.
p294_233|We have seen the future, and it is different.
p294_234|Who does he think will win?
p294_235|We're talking about one or two years.
p294_236|I just have to accept that.
p294_237|He was overwhelmed by the response.
p294_238|They will do nothing for the local people.
p294_239|Do it for us now.
p294_240|We got the guarantee.
p294_241|I couldn't have asked for better.
p294_242|That is however, the only part of the story.
p294_243|But happily, the story is true.
p294_244|They are not suitable.
p294_245|Some days are different from others.
p294_247|Everything else is the same.
p294_248|They never gave up hope.
p294_249|But it was a pleasure.
p294_250|There are no excuses left for us.
p294_251|Mental health is a massive issue.
p294_252|His director of football is leaving.
p294_253|We don't want to be too intrusive.
p294_254|Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
p294_255|There are still some matters to be discussed.
p294_256|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p294_257|I get on him, he gets on me.
p294_258|They are in care for a reason.
p294_259|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
p294_260|I haven't a clue.
p294_261|It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
p294_262|I thought he was terrific.
p294_263|A statement is expected in April.
p294_264|It possibly depends on the position.
p294_265|This will have no effect on the championship.
p294_266|We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
p294_267|I would love to travel with it.
p294_268|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p294_269|It is a common condition in children.
p294_270|We will work through the night.
p294_271|I also thought, This is a feature film.
p294_272|For now, they have gone as far as they can.
p294_273|Boy is the town a mess.
p294_274|It's as simple as that.
p294_275|We've been here before.
p294_276|Neither of them was badly hurt.
p294_277|From there, it was a success story.
p294_278|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
p294_279|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
p294_280|It was one in the afternoon.
p294_281|I've never seen them down here.
p294_282|For some, it might not make too much difference.
p294_283|This is our unfinished business.
p294_284|This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
p294_285|He had asked if they had the script.
p294_286|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p294_287|This could take a few days.
p294_288|A great deal was achieved.
p294_289|So it was sad.
p294_290|It's a blunt instrument anyway.
p294_291|There did not need to be a miracle.
p294_292|This could also affect the sentencing.
p294_293|That case has still not been settled.
p294_294|What do they do, anyway?
p294_295|They've got a mountain to climb.
p294_296|It just would not work.
p294_297|The acting left a lot to be desired.
p294_298|Who will provide the wine?
p294_299|We started from scratch.
p294_300|There was no happiness.
p294_301|Their bid was a very good one.
p294_302|Everything is so commercial.
p294_303|And this tournament will travel.
p294_304|Could it have been better spent?
p294_305|If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
p294_306|The order went out.
p294_307|Cinema is a communal experience.
p294_308|The appeal is impartial.
p294_309|You could see he was thinking about it.
p294_310|He added, We are full of anger.
p294_311|They have nowhere else to go.
p294_312|However, it seems that he got it wrong.
p294_313|We work for the athlete.
p294_314|It is three years at present.
p294_315|The document is a starting point for discussion.
p294_316|We all make mistakes.
p294_317|It didn't put me off.
p294_318|Now they have found out the truth.
p294_319|It is an impressive record.
p294_320|Johnson was pretty low.
p294_321|We know we have done wrong.
p294_322|She was married with one son.
p294_323|I wanted to drop out.
p294_324|I told you so.
p294_325|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
p294_326|Which is where the manager comes in.
p294_327|Is that what people we want?
p294_328|There are so many unanswered questions.
p294_329|Then it was into a series of classes.
p294_330|He wants to play in the Champions League.
p294_331|I'm so happy that she did.
p294_332|The need for further investment is obvious.
p294_333|Iraq has no interest in war.
p294_334|It's hard, but we have had so much to do.
p294_335|But it took a lot of bottle.
p294_336|Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
p294_337|That period was a struggle.
p294_338|No-one else was hurt.
p294_339|What's it for?
p294_340|Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
p294_341|Anything can happen - at any moment.
p294_342|She is an imposing presence.
p294_343|There are moments of joy in politics.
p294_344|Is a drug dealer?
p294_345|Where are you taking her?
p294_346|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p294_347|It's just not our biggest problem.
p294_348|The result could be all down to turnout.
p294_349|I'm not going to change from it.
p294_350|There were no violations.
p294_351|That was the type of man he was.
p294_352|They are not falling now.
p294_353|They had to explain it.
p294_354|We didn't mean to kill him.
p294_355|The support of Britain is assumed.
p294_356|So far he has not done so.
p294_357|He completely loses control.
p294_358|No decision on that was taken.
p294_359|My fitness was very poor.
p294_360|The trial continues today.
p294_361|People come to see the Highlands.
p294_362|Europe is a bonus.
p294_363|It is also used to buy coffins.
p294_364|I've got to provide for my family.
p294_365|Such debate is pointless.
p294_366|And it had two seats.
p294_367|Cooking is intricate and complex.
p294_368|He found it very hard to understand.
p294_369|But it would change the context.
p294_370|But who was driving it?
p294_371|We recorded it at our own expense.
p294_372|But opponents were quick to criticise.
p294_373|Try to save us.
p294_374|We also have had to work the dark side, if you will.
p294_375|We need to increase the membership.
p294_376|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
p294_377|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p294_378|There could be a way back.
p294_379|He edited the press release.
p294_380|Visitors were also impressed.
p294_381|It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.
p294_382|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p294_383|Are there muscular problems?
p294_384|We had our chances.
p294_385|However, many questions remained unanswered.
p294_386|I told her, and she was extremely grateful.
p294_387|He is in the queue.
p294_388|But what is?
p294_389|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p294_390|We have other options.
p294_391|Calvin was back at his best today.
p294_392|My mind was made up.
p294_393|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p294_394|And rugby fans can help.
p294_395|The council's concern is very simple.
p294_396|We are on the path of change.
p294_397|Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.
p294_398|No other vehicle was involved in the accident.
p294_399|It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
p294_400|Of course, it doesn't all come off.
p294_401|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p294_402|He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
p294_403|We will deal with the refugees.
p294_404|The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
p295_001|Please call Stella.
p295_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p295_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p295_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p295_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p295_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p295_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p295_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p295_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p295_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p295_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p295_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p295_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p295_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p295_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p295_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p295_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p295_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p295_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p295_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p295_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p295_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p295_025|It has never been worthwhile.
p295_026|She was on the edge of breaking point.
p295_027|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p295_028|Because we do not need it.
p295_029|It has been supremely successful.
p295_030|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
p295_031|Which is where the manager comes in.
p295_032|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
p295_033|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p295_034|We thought we would never see them again.
p295_035|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
p295_036|She asked me for the appointment with me.
p295_037|He must not be removed from office.
p295_038|That means an extra two years.
p295_039|I think he was nervous to begin with.
p295_040|Our children are the future of our society.
p295_041|I'm sure he would love it.
p295_042|A final agreement has not yet been completed.
p295_043|It's just not our biggest problem.
p295_044|It is just like any other club.
p295_045|Everything is possible in football.
p295_046|I'm sure he didn't mean it.
p295_047|It was very personal and very intimate.
p295_048|We are going to New Broomfield to win.
p295_049|Colin is free to speak with other teams.
p295_050|He declined to give further details.
p295_051|I think it was entirely the right decision.
p295_052|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p295_053|For sure we want to win it.
p295_054|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
p295_055|Such debate is pointless.
p295_056|He is helping police with their inquiries.
p295_057|We recorded it at our own expense.
p295_058|A formal decision will be announced within months.
p295_059|I knew there was a challenge for me.
p295_060|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
p295_061|I just have no maternal instincts.
p295_062|If you're going to do it, do it right.
p295_063|They have a car and cannot afford another.
p295_064|It is, after all, a very funny play.
p295_065|Can you imagine a world without design?
p295_066|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p295_067|And he listens to his artists as well.
p295_068|I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
p295_069|SO now we know the secret.
p295_070|He's right up to a point.
p295_071|We would have looked out for each other.
p295_072|I had no choice but to leave.
p295_073|Where does he go from here?
p295_074|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p295_075|This time, there were no such rewards.
p295_076|But then they scored their fourth.
p295_077|He said, My own position is quite simple.
p295_078|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
p295_079|It has to find out what went wrong.
p295_080|People are already enjoying it.
p295_081|We're just delighted to be back on top.
p295_082|Or is it the European approach?
p295_083|I had found my vision.
p295_084|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
p295_085|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p295_086|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p295_087|I don't entirely buy that.
p295_088|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
p295_089|It is giving out the wrong message.
p295_090|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p295_091|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p295_092|As a nation, we must become more active.
p295_093|Nothing has changed from the season before.
p295_094|I'm not thinking too much about the tour.
p295_095|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p295_096|We recognise it as a key area.
p295_097|The mood was euphoric.
p295_098|The time of judgment has arrived.
p295_099|Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
p295_100|You can take it almost anywhere and practise.
p295_101|We want to be separate from our neighbours.
p295_102|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p295_103|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p295_104|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p295_105|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p295_106|This has been a terrible experience.
p295_107|He had a different agenda entirely.
p295_108|Casualties are a problem for the Kremlin.
p295_109|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p295_110|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p295_111|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p295_112|It is reform in return for resources.
p295_113|It offers a different viewpoint.
p295_114|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
p295_115|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p295_116|I have no plans to retire.
p295_117|The Scots are, however, in good company.
p295_118|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p295_119|There were far more pressing matters to consider.
p295_120|The whole thing in general is moving on.
p295_121|This is a test of our character.
p295_122|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p295_123|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p295_124|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p295_125|The look on his face was something special.
p295_126|You have a very persuasive president.
p295_127|Sure, we have problems.
p295_128|We will provide immediate access.
p295_129|Axis itself was created from that exercise.
p295_130|Five years later, the deception continued.
p295_131|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
p295_132|I can't see myself in one of those.
p295_133|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
p295_134|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
p295_135|He added, We have the same desire.
p295_137|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p295_138|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p295_139|That, however, is the end of the good news.
p295_140|Seven people were later detained by police.
p295_141|I got very, very tired.
p295_142|What did you learn in school today?
p295_143|He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
p295_144|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p295_145|He's working hard on that right now.
p295_146|The jury is still out.
p295_147|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p295_148|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
p295_149|I can't say that this is very usual.
p295_150|We opened up and everything was gone.
p295_151|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
p295_152|We are right at the heart of Europe.
p295_153|I try to be open to experience.
p295_154|I remember it clearly.
p295_155|I'm sure they will be very happy.
p295_156|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p295_157|We must get the three points.
p295_158|There has been a fair bit in between, too.
p295_159|I feel alive and good today.
p295_160|We're in England for the time being.
p295_161|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p295_162|David Trimble has sold out.
p295_163|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p295_164|The voters are our masters.
p295_165|This is great news - a wonderful addition to the programme.
p295_166|He is willing to pay the required amount.
p295_167|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p295_168|He should emerge as the winner.
p295_169|That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
p295_170|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p295_171|The story was being repeated across Scotland.
p295_172|You're not going to forget something like that.
p295_173|They are in the euro.
p295_174|The driver was unhurt.
p295_175|Anything that can be done, the Government will do.
p295_176|It's all about money, money, money.
p295_177|A bit of match fitness is required.
p295_178|It was far from business as usual.
p295_179|There's nothing new in that argument.
p295_180|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p295_181|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p295_182|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p295_183|The deadline is real and absolute.
p295_184|No means testing will be required.
p295_185|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p295_186|I'm sure it will go on.
p295_187|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
p295_188|She is still very poorly.
p295_189|That's how he did the damage.
p295_190|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
p295_191|I need a publishing deal!
p295_192|They tried to give her advice.
p295_193|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p295_194|Defeat is simply not an option.
p295_195|We have all been there at some point.
p295_196|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
p295_197|If they don't want to read it, they don't have to.
p295_198|At least two women were among those arrested.
p295_199|My intentions are to go on like this.
p295_200|It is not attempting to offer a solution.
p295_201|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p295_202|I will be having talks with the workforce.
p295_203|It's like an extension of your body.
p295_204|That's why he is a national treasure.
p295_205|It seems a waste of talents.
p295_206|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p295_207|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p295_208|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p295_209|We need to know more about her.
p295_210|And what is she escaping from?
p295_211|Leaving the Labour Party is one thing.
p295_212|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p295_213|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p295_214|What happened in this instance is serious misconduct.
p295_215|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p295_216|I don't know how they make the weight.
p295_217|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p295_218|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p295_219|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
p295_220|The joint bid is still on course.
p295_221|This is the best moment of my career.
p295_222|My life has been turned upside down.
p295_224|Why is he not fighting for the Union?
p295_225|Parole is a decision for me.
p295_226|It left me with a sadness.
p295_227|We don't have any senior players.
p295_228|Not so, it transpires.
p295_229|Knowledge is everything at this level.
p295_230|This will help our confidence.
p295_231|He has a wealth of experience.
p295_232|It is a very beautiful city.
p295_233|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p295_234|His father and mother are in film production.
p295_235|It's about attitudes to change.
p295_236|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p295_237|We have seen the failure of politics.
p295_238|The party will make up its own mind.
p295_239|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p295_240|I am very sorry to hear about this.
p295_241|I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.
p295_242|Hopefully we can put in a performance.
p295_243|When he came to see me on Monday.
p295_244|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p295_245|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p295_246|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p295_247|Next league matches, Dundee United - Motherwell.
p295_248|It became a book by itself.
p295_249|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
p295_250|She was close to suicide at one stage.
p295_251|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p295_252|What kind of festival is proposed?
p295_253|In my experience, he does not do that.
p295_254|We're all involved in creating the work.
p295_255|When we started the album.
p295_256|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p295_257|Controllers major concern is safety.
p295_258|This is your country.
p295_259|That's the most important thing for me.
p295_260|But it was the sensible thing to do.
p295_261|I think it'll be a great occasion.
p295_262|The committees are due to report next year.
p295_263|It was seriously unpleasant.
p295_264|What was the cause of all this outrage?
p295_265|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p295_266|The bombing has had a huge influence.
p295_267|However, the groups denied the claims.
p295_268|This latter point is hugely important.
p295_269|The airport was even different.
p295_270|Whether this return was too soon.
p295_271|We're playing away from home and that's it.
p295_272|It may be down, but New York is not out.
p295_273|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
p295_274|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p295_275|My view has now completely changed.
p295_276|Manchester United are the classic example.
p295_277|I've never regretted my decision.
p295_278|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p295_279|Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
p295_280|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p295_281|Surely it can't get any worse.
p295_282|He's in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
p295_283|We still have a long, long way to go.
p295_284|He preferred to concentrate on the positive.
p295_285|The Old Firm are going nowhere.
p295_286|I'm not sure.
p295_287|But the championship is not over yet.
p295_288|WE live in a world of large numbers.
p295_289|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p295_290|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p295_291|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p295_292|Anyone can still win this tournament.
p295_293|My husband was angry.
p295_294|You're going to die.
p295_295|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p295_296|We're not really commenting on that.
p295_297|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p295_298|Ferguson is not interested in the finances.
p295_299|Could they perhaps be related?
p295_300|It should be a condition of employment.
p295_301|It was not being marketed properly.
p295_302|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p295_303|They know their son was murdered.
p295_304|I love this tournament.
p295_305|Nobody will be forced to work.
p295_306|We're all going to take a holiday.
p295_307|It is good for Europe.
p295_308|This is your chance.
p295_309|They told him to go to drama school.
p295_310|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
p295_311|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p295_312|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p295_313|I think they are right to be impatient.
p295_314|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
p295_315|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p295_316|The attack was totally out of the blue.
p295_317|It's a member of your family.
p295_318|It's an hour of the same response.
p295_319|There's a good chance of seeing something.
p295_320|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
p295_321|Thirteen people will be made redundant.
p295_322|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
p295_323|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p295_324|It will not work in our favour.
p295_325|We're very close to making it in Europe.
p295_326|It was hugely popular decision.
p295_327|The decision was left entirely to him.
p295_328|They have been contrasting years, certainly.
p295_329|These findings are vitally important.
p295_330|That's always the case, isn't it?
p295_331|I certainly think it should be there.
p295_332|I'm sure that they will learn.
p295_333|His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.
p295_334|When he got up he was hit again.
p295_335|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
p295_336|This time, however, may have been different.
p295_337|We are well insured.
p295_338|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p295_339|However, that could alter following the latest case.
p295_340|It's like a garage.
p295_341|The last few weeks have been really bad.
p295_342|I believe in public services.
p295_343|The atmosphere is businesslike.
p295_344|But you can go beyond that condition.
p295_345|Genetic assessment is crucial.
p295_346|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p295_347|Four years is a long time.
p295_348|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p295_349|No one wants to go through these things.
p295_350|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p295_351|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p295_352|Worse still, it can be infectious.
p295_353|They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
p295_354|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p295_355|He is very much in our thoughts.
p295_356|So what could be better than becoming captain?
p295_357|Our Great Depression is our lives.
p295_358|He was elected as a councillor last year.
p295_359|You are always aware of the injury potential.
p295_360|But that is entirely a matter for them.
p295_361|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p295_362|One Minister said the reports were bizarre.
p295_363|You're not going to get hurt.
p295_364|But no decision has been made.
p295_365|Our traditions and culture remain the same.
p295_366|I decided not to renew the contract.
p295_367|For us, that decision was hard to understand.
p295_368|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p295_369|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
p295_370|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p295_371|She makes me feel very proud.
p295_372|He had been surprised by the local reaction.
p295_373|The voices told me to do it.
p295_374|I am a committed European.
p295_375|There is no point in looking any further.
p295_376|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p295_377|I'm astonished by this decision.
p295_378|General, You didn't get a modified.
p295_379|Surely the answer is yes.
p295_380|It's part of your life.
p295_381|I could go on, but none of these things is true.
p295_382|That sort of thing is long gone.
p295_383|Our proposals are fully costed.
p295_384|We all started running forward.
p295_385|We did not want an absentee landlord.
p295_386|That, however, is only part of the story.
p295_387|It worked well in Monaco.
p295_388|Things were not easy from the outset.
p295_389|The team is in division one in Spain.
p295_390|We don't even know his name.
p295_391|Our position is not a logic of war.
p295_392|I have played really well all year.
p295_393|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p295_394|It was visibly on fire.
p295_395|It was a fiery game.
p295_396|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p295_397|That is European law.
p295_398|It was very lucky no-one was killed.
p295_399|What has caused the demise of singing?
p295_400|He's close friend of Gordon Brown.
p295_401|That is not a position they enjoy.
p295_402|Blair also had a penalty.
p295_403|We wanted to run away with her.
p297_001|Please call Stella.
p297_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p297_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p297_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p297_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p297_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p297_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p297_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p297_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p297_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p297_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say that he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p297_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p297_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p297_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p297_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p297_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p297_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p297_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p297_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p297_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p297_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p297_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p297_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p297_025|But it's been kept to a minimum.
p297_026|We have gone on about him no end.
p297_027|And the art of performance is taking risks.
p297_028|Appointments should be made on merit.
p297_029|I feel strongly about it.
p297_030|Tommy is not a problem.
p297_031|I started on fire a couple of times.
p297_032|Jack McConnell will be making a statement tomorrow.
p297_033|Other forces were, however, at work.
p297_034|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p297_035|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
p297_036|In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
p297_037|My fitness was very poor.
p297_038|You have caught a serial killer.
p297_039|Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
p297_040|I am writing a novel.
p297_041|Fewer people are being killed in accidents.
p297_042|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
p297_043|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
p297_044|Bombing is the easy option.
p297_045|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p297_046|Except for this, it was offside.
p297_047|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p297_048|What do we do for an encore?
p297_049|Things start to talk to each other.
p297_050|At the time, he was a living legend.
p297_051|I would like to stay with Rangers.
p297_052|All will be revealed in due course.
p297_053|It was located on the remote control.
p297_054|January is a bad time of year.
p297_055|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p297_056|That is an important part of our role.
p297_057|From our point of view, it's the right time.
p297_058|You just have to accept.
p297_059|People will see this over time.
p297_060|The tribunal continues today.
p297_061|Basically, the classical tradition won out.
p297_062|It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
p297_063|Nobody can get at them there.
p297_065|It's not only my respect for them.
p297_066|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p297_067|BIG Brother is listening to you.
p297_068|We will be paying agency rates.
p297_069|This is a very high price.
p297_070|In the end, however, it all came together.
p297_071|They can be time consuming.
p297_072|It's a depressing, difficult and demanding job.
p297_074|Subtle it is not.
p297_075|If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.
p297_076|I had a tie in my hand.
p297_077|Raised the way you want it.
p297_078|Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.
p297_079|Then he did it twice.
p297_080|We were short of athletes.
p297_081|You have to do your research.
p297_082|Things were so intense in the studio.
p297_083|Its first awards will do just that.
p297_084|It was the crowning point of my career.
p297_085|You could feel the heat.
p297_086|She is still very poorly.
p297_087|That's how she wants to remember him.
p297_088|Do something that you haven't done before.
p297_090|We talk about effective military action.
p297_091|Craig is a major concern for us.
p297_092|The scientific debate is dead.
p297_093|I sincerely hope not.
p297_094|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p297_095|There is no such thing.
p297_096|However, their reaction could not have been more different.
p297_097|I was doing well at the hustings.
p297_098|My wife and family are the support system.
p297_099|The scheme is hopelessly failing.
p297_100|The body follows the mind.
p297_101|That gives it a spirit.
p297_102|It isn't just a defining issue for them.
p297_103|However, what is his calibre?
p297_104|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
p297_105|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p297_106|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p297_107|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
p297_108|She died in middle age.
p297_109|You need insurance to bring people in.
p297_110|A great deal has been achieved.
p297_111|What was it like playing real people?
p297_112|We are just being flooded.
p297_113|This ruling is unfair to everyone.
p297_114|It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
p297_115|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p297_116|Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
p297_117|The singer's condition was not specified.
p297_118|It's too big a risk to take.
p297_119|It's an expensive part of their equipment.
p297_120|Our lives have been turned upside down.
p297_121|The General Election is all to play for.
p297_122|I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
p297_123|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p297_124|United were in control without always being dominant.
p297_125|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
p297_126|Which brings us to the question of money.
p297_127|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p297_128|It was my shortest audition.
p297_129|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p297_130|It's unsafe for society.
p297_131|Three penalties were given.
p297_132|But that's not the idea behind this article.
p297_133|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
p297_134|What did they think of her voice?
p297_135|Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
p297_136|We were extremely poor.
p297_137|He needed a kidney - it's as simple as that.
p297_138|It was better than a soap opera.
p297_139|It's not a great art.
p297_140|She took them for a term.
p297_141|It is easy to agree with him.
p297_142|Nato was not a love affair.
p297_143|We believe that the reason is poverty.
p297_144|It's my nature.
p297_145|He was shocked by what he saw.
p297_146|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p297_147|We had a really good experience with David.
p297_148|Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
p297_149|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p297_150|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
p297_151|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
p297_152|I will go out with him any time.
p297_153|That's my big challenge.
p297_154|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p297_155|They said we were out of touch.
p297_156|My son was too young to die.
p297_157|Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
p297_158|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p297_159|The captaincy will help that, too.
p297_160|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p297_161|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p297_162|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
p297_163|We meet again in Berlin.
p297_164|It's always the same, isn't it?
p297_165|Don't get me wrong.
p297_166|He died from multiple injuries.
p297_167|They would never let him go.
p297_168|That could be in place by next year.
p297_169|I'm going to buy a car.
p297_170|Which is worse?
p297_171|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p297_172|I'm not talking about his career.
p297_173|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
p297_174|But what lies ahead?
p297_175|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p297_176|It was like the old days.
p297_177|I couldn't honestly tell you.
p297_178|The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
p297_179|The first time you read a play.
p297_180|We are committed to urgent action.
p297_181|I wish him well.
p297_182|Others may be trying to catch up.
p297_183|I read it every year.
p297_184|I think we've got the balance right.
p297_185|There is no guarantee.
p297_186|Some may end up in hospital.
p297_187|I'll tell you honestly.
p297_188|I let go the telephone and ran.
p297_189|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p297_190|There's not much money in cycling.
p297_191|Public safety is paramount.
p297_192|We've never seen so many.
p297_193|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
p297_194|I'm sure you all can relate to that.
p297_195|Scots actors should be so lucky.
p297_196|I was just doing my job.
p297_197|Blood samples were taken.
p297_198|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p297_199|Any error is severely punished.
p297_200|They tend to be female and retired.
p297_201|I think it will make a huge difference.
p297_202|We have a high quality product.
p297_203|The home team also had their moments.
p297_204|I have played well the past two days.
p297_205|He has not created a Festival resource.
p297_206|From day one, we were a family.
p297_207|Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
p297_208|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p297_209|It's a metaphor for consumption.
p297_210|He's an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p297_211|That's hard for a woman.
p297_212|THE atmosphere was electric.
p297_213|The boys are very confident.
p297_215|This club have been fair to me.
p297_216|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
p297_217|Access has been a nightmare.
p297_218|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
p297_219|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
p297_220|The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.
p297_221|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p297_222|There has been no reaction from them.
p297_223|She failed in her action.
p297_224|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p297_225|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p297_226|The group will report back in the summer.
p297_227|She looked so young.
p297_228|I will let you in on a secret.
p297_229|Don't you think it was a fine performance?
p297_230|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p297_231|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p297_232|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p297_233|We need a visionary producer.
p297_234|I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
p297_235|Some were close to tears.
p297_236|I saw it at a ruck.
p297_237|I have great confidence in Annabelle.
p297_238|He's a sort of mystery figure.
p297_239|Europe is not a threat to Britain.
p297_240|He just wants to leave a legacy.
p297_241|Every game against New Zealand is.
p297_242|Dialogue is the key.
p297_243|But they didn't much like that.
p297_244|We just wish they had done so before.
p297_245|I am sorry to hear this news.
p297_246|However we're capable of beating them.
p297_247|They chose the latter.
p297_248|I've not said anything to them, they know.
p297_249|It's like a high school play.
p297_250|That is how it will be judged.
p297_251|It's there for people to look at.
p297_254|Who did the recruiting?
p297_255|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p297_256|However, we had no failures in our side.
p297_257|This is his first movie.
p297_258|The farmers had no choice in the matter.
p297_259|They were assured that it would.
p297_260|I'm the one who has to suffer.
p297_261|She was charged with perjury.
p297_262|With us, we just want them to respond.
p297_263|But something has been lost in the translation.
p297_264|That's the last thing they need.
p297_265|I made a big mistake.
p297_266|England against France is always a big game.
p297_267|When he came to see me on Monday.
p297_268|Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
p297_269|The criteria have changed.
p297_270|A new school will be built.
p297_271|Who reminded him about the score?
p297_272|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
p297_273|I will not walk away from this job.
p297_274|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
p297_275|How do you find the youngsters?
p297_276|They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
p297_277|It does not move, which is amazing.
p297_278|We've always had a very positive attitude.
p297_279|Part of England, is not?
p297_280|It may have been a cry for help.
p297_281|There were no passengers on board.
p297_282|Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
p297_283|This is wrong, but that's believed.
p297_284|They were not up to the required standard.
p297_285|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
p297_286|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p297_287|Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
p297_288|We want to replicate that success.
p297_289|I couldn't put my finger on it.
p297_290|Taxation should be simplified.
p297_291|That's a trend which will be encouraged.
p297_292|He looked at me before replying.
p297_293|But today was the real big one.
p297_294|Someone else can do the cooking that night.
p297_295|That idea is rubbish.
p297_296|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
p297_297|He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
p297_298|After that, we made some changes.
p297_299|It has not yet opened to pupils.
p297_300|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p297_301|Almost overnight, he found his voice.
p297_302|I want my audience to be challenged.
p297_303|It was quite a new prescription.
p297_304|That, too, was over two years ago.
p297_305|Who do you think you are?
p297_306|Glasgow is a tour de force.
p297_307|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p297_308|I can understand why they have gone.
p297_309|They will give it a couple of years.
p297_310|Your father was a good man.
p297_311|Bob Dylan's getting old.
p297_312|Our number one goal is prevention.
p297_313|Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
p297_314|And he is immensely loyal.
p297_315|The actor has met with Mandela.
p297_316|But there was no time for that.
p297_317|He confirmed that there had been no warning.
p297_318|I am not against a further inquiry.
p297_319|The company's in good shape.
p297_320|There are different cultures in different departments.
p297_321|He was caught and fired.
p297_322|I was pregnant and very worried.
p297_323|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p297_324|I'll never have problems with any football managers.
p297_325|It's only tackling congestion.
p297_326|I came into this world with nothing.
p297_327|You will never replace the child.
p297_328|I'm delighted at Murray's appointment.
p297_329|Off with their heads.
p297_330|There will have to be a full inquiry.
p297_331|They are now out in the cold.
p297_332|The way ahead is not easy.
p297_333|He intends to appeal the sentences.
p297_334|There is no smoking gun.
p297_335|His primary residence is Scotland.
p297_336|It's an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p297_337|You are going to take away my life.
p297_338|That was one very hard game.
p297_339|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p297_340|This is the start of a slippery slope.
p297_341|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p297_342|Don't hold your breath.
p297_343|The girls are ready to compete.
p297_344|O, Is there anything in the wound?
p297_345|Mini rugby is a great thing.
p297_346|It was blown out of proportion.
p297_347|We certainly hope we have been successful.
p297_348|Surely it can do better than that?
p297_349|It was all too little, too late.
p297_350|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
p297_351|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
p297_352|It is only one night, after all.
p297_353|The professor said the results were positive.
p297_354|Gilbert was not amused.
p297_355|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p297_356|The course record was in his name.
p297_357|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p297_358|He said he had no reports of casualties.
p297_359|It's easy to see why.
p297_360|The board is currently resolving its differences.
p297_361|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p297_362|He had lost his confidence again.
p297_363|So, where do we go from here?
p297_364|I was never alone with her, right?
p297_365|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
p297_366|I think we'll just keep it.
p297_367|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
p297_368|It has proved a double whammy.
p297_369|We make good weapons.
p297_370|The vacancies are in support services and arts.
p297_371|What has changed?
p297_372|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p297_373|It's like English in its underwear.
p297_374|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p297_375|This is the same old story.
p297_376|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p297_377|All of us in Scotland should be vigilant.
p297_378|They finished second and third.
p297_379|Everyone has his share of trouble.
p297_380|You need a licence to run a pub.
p297_381|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p297_382|I don't want a burial service.
p297_383|And it's time for new leadership.
p297_384|I'm not sure.
p297_385|One might think that is a power.
p297_386|We've been calling for a level playing field.
p297_387|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
p297_388|We have big ideas.
p297_389|I hope the voters will respond.
p297_390|And who would argue with that?
p297_391|I believe that gap is nearly there.
p297_392|This is the real thing now.
p297_393|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p297_394|I ran to get out of the way.
p297_395|It was to be published next month.
p297_396|It's not a party, no, no.
p297_397|We have understood the problems for some time.
p297_398|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p297_399|The work with Alison was a great experience.
p297_400|She now lives in London.
p297_401|But every country has its own character.
p297_402|I don't have a problem with getting older.
p297_403|In addition, it was just a breach of natural justice.
p297_404|I played really well on the back nine.
p298_001|Please call Stella.
p298_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p298_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p298_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p298_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p298_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p298_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p298_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p298_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p298_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p298_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p298_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p298_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p298_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p298_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p298_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p298_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p298_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p298_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p298_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p298_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p298_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p298_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p298_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p298_025|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
p298_026|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p298_027|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
p298_028|That is just a load of baloney.
p298_029|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p298_030|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
p298_031|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p298_032|The feeling is marvellous.
p298_033|I think they should have more respect.
p298_034|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p298_035|They are interior designers and architects.
p298_036|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p298_037|Others may be trying to catch up.
p298_038|It was a crucial moment.
p298_039|We gave everything we had.
p298_040|I let go the telephone and ran.
p298_041|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
p298_042|His charisma is all on the course.
p298_043|This is purely financial.
p298_044|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p298_045|Our dispute is with the company, not with the travelling public.
p298_046|I did not want any damage to us.
p298_047|It was an easy decision to come here.
p298_048|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
p298_049|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
p298_050|I saw them not long after it happened.
p298_051|This guy is never going to give up.
p298_052|Who said impatience is a virtue?
p298_053|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p298_054|You've got to have everything inside with you.
p298_055|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
p298_056|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p298_057|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p298_058|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p298_059|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p298_060|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p298_061|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p298_062|Don't say you have not been warned.
p298_063|That is a mark of what you are.
p298_064|Seven children had lost both parents.
p298_065|It is par for the course, isn't it?
p298_066|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
p298_067|Most people know that.
p298_068|Some people still think she should be English.
p298_069|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p298_070|Repayment is not part of the game.
p298_071|The cause of the crash was unclear.
p298_072|What do they pay to join the club?
p298_073|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
p298_074|We are now in a safe place.
p298_075|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
p298_076|It will be very useful for us.
p298_077|He was obviously very genuine.
p298_078|We just try to make great records.
p298_079|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p298_080|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p298_081|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
p298_082|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p298_083|His parenthood is called into question.
p298_084|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p298_085|We really need research to help with that.
p298_086|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p298_087|There were no passengers on board.
p298_088|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
p298_089|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
p298_090|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p298_091|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p298_092|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p298_093|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p298_094|Scotland were beaten again.
p298_095|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p298_096|The League of Nations was also his idea.
p298_097|I've done it almost like a variety show.
p298_098|She is on a life support machine.
p298_099|Their vision was not impeded.
p298_100|Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
p298_101|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p298_102|Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
p298_103|He went to see what he could learn.
p298_104|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
p298_105|Referees are easy targets.
p298_106|The luxury has been well used.
p298_107|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p298_108|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p298_109|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p298_110|There was no time scale.
p298_111|Only the scale of change differed.
p298_112|Tell you the team he picked?
p298_113|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p298_114|The cold war is over.
p298_115|I'd like to take the plunge.
p298_116|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p298_117|And it's more subversive.
p298_118|We are losing this war.
p298_119|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p298_120|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p298_121|They will know they deserve to be there.
p298_122|I've got no secret.
p298_123|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p298_124|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p298_125|I asked why he had come.
p298_126|Will they ever reopen?
p298_127|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p298_128|A lot of people were in tears.
p298_129|We have great team spirit.
p298_130|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p298_131|He loves the big occasions.
p298_132|They should take their mobile phones.
p298_133|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p298_134|We have big ideas.
p298_135|I first met him last summer.
p298_136|It was to be published next month.
p298_137|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p298_138|It could have been a hammering by now.
p298_139|Subs not used, Fernandez.
p298_140|I played really well on the back nine.
p298_141|It's a bit like a bereavement.
p298_142|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
p298_143|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
p298_144|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
p298_145|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p298_146|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
p298_147|I always knew she was funny.
p298_148|All kinds of things occur.
p298_149|I expected these kind of questions.
p298_150|It was fit for royalty.
p298_151|It is always the same, isn't it?
p298_152|Who would take it now, after all this?
p298_153|I felt really good until Friday.
p298_154|That gives us something to kick against.
p298_155|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p298_156|Equity declined to comment.
p298_157|There is precious little middle ground.
p298_158|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
p298_159|The inquiry had been going on for months.
p298_160|They were both delightful to work with.
p298_161|It's my delight on a shiny night.
p298_162|I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.
p298_163|It's now down in black and white.
p298_164|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p298_165|It is quite an eye opener.
p298_166|Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.
p298_167|What, they maybe have three Scottish players?
p298_168|Can they be serious?
p298_169|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
p298_170|That, in our view, is an important decision.
p298_171|It's just that we see different things.
p298_172|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p298_173|We are all family men with children.
p298_174|I think we showed that after half time.
p298_175|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p298_176|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
p298_177|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
p298_178|You let a lot of people down.
p298_179|One person was believed to have been hit.
p298_180|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
p298_181|We aren't going to play better.
p298_182|They just would not have run away.
p298_183|Two men have been charged with his murder.
p298_184|Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
p298_185|The guys have really enjoyed it.
p298_186|Charles Clarke is an idiot.
p298_187|Our people should be immune.
p298_188|Glasgow then took control.
p298_189|It is simple and easy to use.
p298_190|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
p298_191|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p298_192|I think we finished fifth.
p298_193|It was not a foul.
p298_194|We know them as mobile telephones.
p298_195|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
p298_196|I don't know exactly what happened.
p298_197|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p298_198|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p298_199|The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
p298_200|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
p298_201|It was a very difficult decision for us.
p298_202|I am not a happy man.
p298_203|You can be sure we will have problems.
p298_204|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p298_205|I'm going with all three.
p298_206|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
p298_207|The line-up is a tasty one.
p298_208|I don't honestly know how to describe it.
p298_209|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p298_210|He had taken everything from me.
p298_211|Many, many people don't know who he is.
p298_212|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
p298_213|They should also have the right to vote.
p298_214|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
p298_215|WHAT's in a name is this, the age of the Internet?
p298_216|People are so negative about the whole business.
p298_217|They had given up on him.
p298_218|We didn't know if people would turn up.
p298_219|It has made me feel good.
p298_220|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
p298_221|We have our supporters and our enemies.
p298_222|She has now been registered as disabled.
p298_223|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p298_224|I was living with my mum.
p298_225|It did my image a lot of good!
p298_226|This Government believes in parental discipline.
p298_227|It's been a long, long journey.
p298_228|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p298_229|But there has never been the time, she said.
p298_230|This could be one such case, he declared.
p298_231|I fell in love with ballet.
p298_232|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p298_233|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p298_234|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p298_235|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p298_236|We're still talking with a few people.
p298_237|But one shouldn't go by that.
p298_238|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p298_239|I think in three dimensions.
p298_240|They had four children together.
p298_241|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
p298_242|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
p298_243|How can they engage with the work?
p298_244|All were later allowed home.
p298_245|She has a wonderful mind.
p298_246|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p298_247|We're into that build-up now.
p298_248|It is the end of an era.
p298_249|We can just get on with our game.
p298_250|But first it goes out on TV.
p298_251|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
p298_252|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
p298_253|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p298_254|I learned a lot from her.
p298_255|We have reacted well to each other.
p298_256|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p298_257|They seem to be backing off from that.
p298_258|They have a very good method of working.
p298_259|Do you think you have a shot?
p298_260|I believe we have a good chance.
p298_261|Things were not easy from the outset.
p298_262|She may even appear in some more films.
p298_263|We've had great things in the past.
p298_264|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p298_265|I've seen some of the submissions.
p298_266|There is no such thing.
p298_267|I feel very strongly about that.
p298_268|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p298_269|After that nothing could save him.
p298_270|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p298_271|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p298_272|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p298_273|It is now very clear that doesn't work.
p298_274|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p298_275|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p298_276|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p298_277|Last year, however, was a different story.
p298_278|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p298_279|I bought a car at auction.
p298_280|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p298_281|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p298_282|She had been sexually assaulted.
p298_283|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p298_284|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
p298_285|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p298_286|We have been treated with complete contempt.
p298_287|There is no smoking gun.
p298_288|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
p298_289|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
p298_290|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p298_291|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p298_292|I have been coming here for nine years.
p298_293|I felt under no pressure today.
p298_294|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p298_295|And that was the adults.
p298_296|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p298_297|That is a job for the Government.
p298_298|I felt the head was very like me.
p298_299|And he had much need.
p298_300|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p298_301|This can only help us go forward.
p298_302|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p298_303|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p298_304|Andrew McLellan is no exception.
p298_305|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p298_306|Some have other commitments.
p298_307|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p298_308|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p298_309|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p298_310|The crowd was awesome.
p298_311|That was moving the goalposts.
p298_312|We have the location, which is assured.
p298_313|Rapid revision was required.
p298_314|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p298_315|We couldn't go very fast.
p298_316|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p298_317|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p298_318|We have grown up in Britain.
p298_319|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p298_320|I am proud of those guys.
p298_321|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p298_322|It is too early to speculate.
p298_323|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p298_324|I'll go out and be aggressive.
p298_325|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p298_326|What is the truth about the cow?
p298_327|They will want to watch a winning team.
p298_328|Who is going to be penalised?
p298_329|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p298_330|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p298_331|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p298_332|I have a theory.
p298_333|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p298_334|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p298_335|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
p298_336|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p298_337|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
p298_338|I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
p298_339|Some of his family still live there.
p298_340|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p298_341|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p298_342|I get to work with very good people.
p298_343|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p298_344|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p298_345|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p298_346|I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
p298_347|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p298_348|I can appear to be nice and lovely.
p298_349|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p298_350|People tended to stay there for some time.
p298_351|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p298_352|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p298_353|This represents a tough game for us.
p298_354|He saw it all as a big game.
p298_355|The boy is no longer with us.
p298_356|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
p298_357|I would urge the Government to think again.
p298_358|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p298_359|I was happiest with my short game.
p298_360|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
p298_361|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
p298_362|As if he were a High Court judge.
p298_363|Would he be able to live with that?
p298_364|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
p298_365|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p298_366|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p298_367|And a film maker was born.
p298_368|It was also put on the Internet.
p298_369|He also has a Scottish grandfather.
p298_370|Now that was a boxing movie.
p298_371|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p298_372|There was a battle there.
p298_373|I might also completely change the routine.
p298_374|Today's ruling confirms that fact.
p298_375|It's good news and long overdue.
p298_376|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p298_377|I have learned a lot from him.
p298_378|He has been campaigning for change for years.
p298_379|I have beaten her a few times.
p298_380|They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
p298_381|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
p298_382|We are being hijacked.
p298_383|Mike Tyson went to prison.
p298_384|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p298_385|This is the first stage of catching up.
p299_001|Please call Stella.
p299_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p299_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p299_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p299_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p299_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p299_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p299_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p299_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p299_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p299_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p299_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p299_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p299_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p299_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p299_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p299_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p299_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p299_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p299_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p299_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p299_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p299_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p299_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p299_025|I just went for it over the weekend.
p299_026|I managed to take her completely by surprise.
p299_027|It is only one night, after all.
p299_028|Gilbert was not amused.
p299_029|My first season in Scotland was fantastic.
p299_030|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
p299_031|It has moved on in the last week.
p299_032|It's easy to see why.
p299_033|I am proud of moments like that.
p299_034|This is a totally different order of agreement.
p299_035|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p299_036|He was arrested, but later released without charge.
p299_037|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p299_038|This is a big advantage.
p299_039|I think we have a very strong case.
p299_040|We agreed to disagree.
p299_041|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
p299_042|If you look at the beginning of Alien.
p299_043|I've learned from my mistakes.
p299_044|Today is not about contracts.
p299_045|It should be a great game, though.
p299_046|That says something for his strength of character.
p299_047|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p299_048|It's to do with play.
p299_049|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p299_050|I've just got to do this.
p299_051|Rangers will have a massive support in Glasgow.
p299_052|That was the problem.
p299_053|Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
p299_054|I have been here for only three months.
p299_055|Everything else is second.
p299_056|I think it is a sensible change.
p299_057|Sex is fun?
p299_058|They were not doing it too well, either.
p299_059|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p299_060|He had played well in that central role.
p299_061|We hope this scheme will change that.
p299_062|It was created by genocide.
p299_063|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p299_064|How could anyone take issue with that?
p299_065|He takes time out for everyone.
p299_066|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p299_067|Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
p299_068|A number of people could not speak English.
p299_069|They have got off with murder.
p299_070|They had had time for little else.
p299_071|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p299_072|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p299_073|It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
p299_074|The settlement could run to millions.
p299_075|It does not stop at the border.
p299_076|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p299_077|How can they say that?
p299_078|Robert is a special talent.
p299_079|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
p299_080|She added, It is a huge problem.
p299_081|You can't keep them separate.
p299_082|I still feel like a wee boy.
p299_083|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p299_084|But there was a shift.
p299_085|Israel has done very little until now.
p299_086|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p299_087|We are losing this war.
p299_088|A decision is expected today.
p299_089|The death rates are still as high.
p299_090|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p299_091|There is a growing anger among the group.
p299_092|We certainly will need to watch him.
p299_093|I don't think it could be clearer.
p299_094|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p299_095|Our offer will remain on the table.
p299_096|We are trying to establish a date.
p299_097|He is a man who lives to work.
p299_098|The website is now being amended.
p299_099|It was a bit of a struggle today.
p299_100|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
p299_101|It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
p299_102|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p299_103|He had a heart problem.
p299_104|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p299_105|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p299_106|That was the light relief.
p299_107|I am a wealthy person.
p299_108|He has one son and one daughter.
p299_109|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p299_110|That, he claimed, was essential.
p299_111|I have great respect for all my players.
p299_112|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p299_113|He had other things on his mind.
p299_114|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p299_115|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p299_116|The next few months will tell.
p299_117|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p299_118|It is crucial for both teams.
p299_119|I am happy with my form.
p299_120|You can see their point.
p299_121|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p299_122|They married in August last year.
p299_123|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
p299_124|Yet he chose to do something different.
p299_125|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
p299_126|There were no casualties.
p299_127|I've just got to build on this now.
p299_128|I was pleased with my own game.
p299_129|The case will now go to appeal.
p299_130|They really did a great job.
p299_131|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p299_132|Where is the anthrax?
p299_133|Bombing is the easy option.
p299_134|I love you so very much.
p299_135|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p299_136|The road was closed for several hours.
p299_137|They can be time consuming.
p299_138|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p299_139|I had a tie in my hand.
p299_140|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p299_141|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
p299_142|Such a city does not exist.
p299_143|My aim is a top six finish.
p299_144|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p299_145|This has a number of benefits.
p299_146|There is too much at stake for that.
p299_147|That is in the very nature of farming.
p299_148|These matters are now behind us.
p299_149|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p299_150|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p299_151|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p299_152|It was then into overtime.
p299_153|Most of the public are behind me.
p299_154|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p299_155|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p299_156|I am still very much a director.
p299_157|I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.
p299_158|But we are severely limited in funds.
p299_159|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
p299_160|Meanwhile, the problems of Ball continue to multiply.
p299_161|My house was shaking at the time.
p299_162|They will know they deserve to be there.
p299_163|Of course he is.
p299_164|This is a huge confidence boost.
p299_165|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p299_166|And does it?
p299_167|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p299_168|Nobody even knew it had happened.
p299_169|Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
p299_170|She is a very lucky lady.
p299_171|Was it a foul?
p299_172|Jamming would be equally difficult.
p299_173|We've been there for seven years.
p299_174|He was as good as his word.
p299_175|Promises were not kept.
p299_176|My life has been destroyed.
p299_177|His signature is his handwriting.
p299_178|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p299_179|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
p299_180|It's not in my nature.
p299_181|You see - this business is a good one.
p299_182|Who is he?
p299_183|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p299_184|Our members are concerned about their futures.
p299_185|It was that bad, that low.
p299_186|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p299_187|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p299_188|It worked, up to a point.
p299_189|There was no rescue.
p299_190|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
p299_191|I can't stand this sort of stuff.
p299_192|It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
p299_193|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
p299_194|Is Saddam a threat?
p299_195|We've got a great defensive club.
p299_196|Darrell was, however, adamant.
p299_197|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p299_198|I feel privileged to be here.
p299_199|I'm not afraid of that.
p299_200|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
p299_201|She told me to apply for the crest.
p299_202|He explained to his audience.
p299_203|I think the Government should pay for that.
p299_204|I never made any offer to Mark.
p299_205|The actors are confident and polished.
p299_206|The budget was too low for that.
p299_207|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p299_208|I'm a bit annoyed.
p299_209|On that they agree.
p299_210|I just could not cope.
p299_211|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p299_212|It is all one-sided.
p299_213|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p299_214|Here are some possible solutions.
p299_215|IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
p299_216|They were both very brave.
p299_217|He made so many bad decisions.
p299_218|We are now up against it.
p299_219|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
p299_220|I would have dropped out otherwise.
p299_221|She said No, he's not in Elgin today.
p299_222|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
p299_223|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
p299_224|But the row refused to go away.
p299_225|Our biggest threat is the BBC.
p299_226|Bill is a mentor.
p299_227|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p299_228|This must be really short of ideas.
p299_229|I think he has undergone a sea change.
p299_230|I believe you may be that person.
p299_231|It was a big day.
p299_232|What makes a house a home?
p299_233|I think however, he was having a fit!
p299_234|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p299_235|I will not be pressured.
p299_236|I had another good day.
p299_237|I hate the word.
p299_238|We should be trying to keep him in.
p299_239|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p299_240|I would say so.
p299_241|Even for a British Open, this is different.
p299_242|I was the only one arguing differently.
p299_243|Sub Not Used, McKay.
p299_244|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
p299_245|Mind you, who wouldn't?
p299_246|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
p299_247|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p299_248|It was a tactical change.
p299_249|She had kept the news from him.
p299_250|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p299_251|With this line-up, they didn't need to be.
p299_252|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
p299_253|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
p299_254|One of these problems is the railways.
p299_255|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p299_256|We don't have the credible evidence.
p299_257|It's one up to the Scots.
p299_258|I'm just doing artwork.
p299_259|He is a right bastard.
p299_260|I don't want to use the term.
p299_261|And we still have to pay his salary.
p299_262|Also, he was flawed.
p299_263|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p299_264|So there's a double whammy.
p299_265|I didn't have a trio.
p299_266|Their three other children had died as infants.
p299_267|We knew nothing about it.
p299_268|She is a great talent.
p299_269|I hope my successor will do the same.
p299_270|I learned that only yesterday.
p299_271|We do things in an appropriate way.
p299_272|I have been totally taken aback by this.
p299_273|Are you in this movie?
p299_274|We have got a full house tonight.
p299_275|The things writers and directors say!
p299_276|The fans will support us.
p299_277|Is this new report the answer?
p299_278|It was a long process, but we got there.
p299_279|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p299_280|We need to be looking to the future.
p299_281|The whole team was rubbish.
p299_282|But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
p299_283|Some of the players have not progressed.
p299_284|It is quite an eye opener.
p299_285|You've got it coming Kabul.
p299_286|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p299_287|Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
p299_288|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p299_289|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
p299_290|Are his works inside out?
p299_291|There is a cup final at stake.
p299_292|It's the curse of our time, irony.
p299_293|It was not a difficult decision, he said.
p299_294|It's a source of deep concern.
p299_295|I am not a free trader.
p299_296|There were so many characters among them.
p299_297|It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
p299_298|However, there are also many areas of agreement.
p299_299|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p299_300|The Dow Jones is way up.
p299_301|Now there's an even bigger target.
p299_302|They were the better side on the day.
p299_303|No decision on that was taken.
p299_304|What went wrong?
p299_305|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p299_306|They chose to side with terror.
p299_307|This must have been severe.
p299_308|We're all in a state of shock.
p299_309|I thought he was part of the camera.
p299_310|Farmers have been an endangered species.
p299_311|We are in a learning curve.
p299_312|Why should we have been asked to share?
p299_313|He was released in March this year.
p299_314|She was just that sort of person.
p299_315|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p299_316|Instead, she just went away.
p299_317|I've seen some of the submissions.
p299_318|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p299_319|It was chaotic and frightening.
p299_320|I think in three dimensions.
p299_321|It is a question of balance.
p299_322|Soon the whole country will be level.
p299_323|He's very young but he is growing up.
p299_324|The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
p299_325|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p299_326|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p299_327|We could not have asked for any more.
p299_328|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p299_329|People might not actually want the job.
p299_330|It is the logical extension of audio description.
p299_331|His rival's are spoken with elan.
p299_332|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
p299_333|I have a bunch of veterans.
p299_334|I am not retiring.
p299_335|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
p299_336|The package has been properly costed.
p299_337|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p299_338|We will work through the night.
p299_339|Barry will be able to handle this.
p299_340|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p299_341|We just need the Government to act.
p299_342|The urgency is real.
p299_343|The criminal justice system does not do that.
p299_344|He will never walk the streets again.
p299_345|We're very excited and challenged by the project.
p299_346|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p299_347|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
p299_348|They are just bewildered and very concerned.
p299_349|I can't stop people thinking.
p299_350|The workers said they were treated like animals.
p299_351|That's the last thing he will do.
p299_352|I have not been so angry for years.
p299_353|I am ready for that.
p299_354|Do you mean today?
p299_355|This is normal for him now.
p299_356|But my heart is in athletics.
p299_357|Nobody ever gets to see them.
p299_358|A review group will report on Tuesday.
p299_359|Yet he left a few days later.
p299_360|The place became a war zone.
p299_361|What's happening to her?
p299_362|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
p299_363|Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
p299_364|The surprise is its product is so poor.
p299_365|I don't have a new house.
p299_366|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
p299_367|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
p299_368|Horses have some sense.
p299_369|The plot is minimal.
p299_370|See it while you can.
p299_371|The plane was in flames
p299_372|But then, that really is the point.
p299_373|One policeman was killed.
p299_374|I didn't do too badly myself.
p299_375|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p299_376|We have been working together for some years.
p299_377|Chris Paterson is a class act.
p299_378|He has never even been to Ireland.
p299_379|And that's the question for the Chamber.
p299_380|Do what you have to do.
p299_381|I'm getting back up there now.
p299_382|We believe the squad will stay together.
p299_383|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p299_384|There is a lot of anger.
p299_385|We suspect he was pleased.
p300_001|Please call Stella.
p300_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p300_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p300_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p300_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p300_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p300_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p300_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p300_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p300_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p300_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p300_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p300_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p300_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p300_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war on heavy rain.
p300_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p300_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p300_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p300_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p300_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p300_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p300_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p300_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p300_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p300_025|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p300_026|This is not a floating Las Vegas.
p300_027|It is not an amnesty.
p300_028|The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.
p300_029|Of course, this is nice to hear.
p300_030|It was between myself, the management, and the team.
p300_031|I don't believe you own anything.
p300_032|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
p300_033|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p300_034|Blood samples have been taken.
p300_035|Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
p300_036|He said he now intends to fly today.
p300_037|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p300_038|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p300_039|A further police inquiry is currently being held.
p300_040|Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
p300_041|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p300_042|A recording contract is on the horizon.
p300_043|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p300_044|We like being the underdogs.
p300_045|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
p300_046|We will continue to operate within the sport.
p300_047|But the law is very clear on this.
p300_048|But all forms of the illness are treatable.
p300_049|It is also central to the unfolding drama.
p300_050|Except for this, it was offside.
p300_051|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
p300_052|It's a grey area.
p300_053|Retirement, who knows?
p300_054|He was shocked by what he saw.
p300_055|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p300_056|It comes on like a tidal wave.
p300_057|England and Wales are likely to pull out.
p300_058|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally placed.
p300_059|He was taken ill in December last year.
p300_060|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p300_061|It's all too short term.
p300_062|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
p300_063|Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
p300_064|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p300_065|His rival's are spoken with elan.
p300_066|He also does not get along with Christina.
p300_067|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
p300_068|How things have changed since then.
p300_069|Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
p300_070|This is the way things should be handled.
p300_071|For me, the tour is wide open this year.
p300_072|In the past few years, they have started to fight back.
p300_073|The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
p300_074|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
p300_075|She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.
p300_076|Henman is taking nothing for granted.
p300_077|You'd think there was a match on today.
p300_078|We must move on.
p300_079|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p300_080|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
p300_081|His options are severely limited.
p300_082|This is truly field of miracles.
p300_083|They are not an item.
p300_084|Why did they let him go?
p300_085|Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.
p300_086|I have made good progress.
p300_087|We do need a new one.
p300_088|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p300_089|We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
p300_090|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p300_091|He then had a swipe at Hearts.
p300_092|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p300_093|But the relief was short-lived.
p300_094|You had better believe it.
p300_095|The mood is upbeat.
p300_096|He told us about it the next day.
p300_097|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p300_098|There are a huge number of arts.
p300_099|They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
p300_100|My office is bare.
p300_101|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p300_102|Where is the anthrax?
p300_103|Housing is in very short supply.
p300_104|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
p300_105|People just came on their own.
p300_106|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
p300_107|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
p300_108|You either have him or you don't.
p300_109|There are some new buildings in there.
p300_110|I am prepared to step down.
p300_111|I'm not a diva.
p300_112|There is great relief at this point.
p300_113|Look at them after three days of rain.
p300_114|I didn't realise it had reached that stage.
p300_115|There is no point in pushing it.
p300_116|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p300_117|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p300_118|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
p300_119|Completion is expected by October the following year.
p300_120|However, it very nearly all went wrong.
p300_121|It is not a definite proposal as yet.
p300_122|I will speak to Michael about this.
p300_123|This is not understood by people outside.
p300_124|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
p300_125|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p300_126|There is a lack of chemistry.
p300_127|I went straight to the toilet.
p300_128|She says the royal family get on well.
p300_129|Does a firefighter have to be killed?
p300_130|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
p300_131|That group reported just before Christmas.
p300_132|I've always been desperate to play this part.
p300_133|We haven't actually considered it down here.
p300_134|There is still much work to be done.
p300_135|However, details have yet to be worked out.
p300_136|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
p300_137|One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
p300_138|We were with him the whole time.
p300_139|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
p300_140|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
p300_141|That's because we work hard at it.
p300_142|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p300_143|He's been the key to everything.
p300_144|Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
p300_145|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p300_146|They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
p300_147|We need a new kind of theatre.
p300_148|I was in the train station overnight.
p300_149|I feel my life to be at risk.
p300_150|Again and again, at every level, he delivered the goods.
p300_151|That would be poetic, wouldn't it?
p300_152|We came across the first set of bodies.
p300_153|We need some confidence to get a win.
p300_154|Does that put pressure on us?
p300_155|You've seen the polls then, Sean.
p300_156|This is a foolish idea.
p300_157|You might even have seen him.
p300_158|Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
p300_159|They thought they had found a home.
p300_160|She collapsed and died a day later.
p300_161|You should be there with six different characters.
p300_162|Laura is an investment banker.
p300_163|I took a minibus into town.
p300_164|I do my job.
p300_165|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p300_166|Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
p300_167|Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
p300_168|Four policemen were wounded.
p300_169|Who do these people think they are?
p300_170|What has caused the demise of singing?
p300_171|We want to help them through it.
p300_172|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
p300_173|It has been recorded twice.
p300_174|It was a bit like having children.
p300_175|You cannot eat in the dining room.
p300_176|It is very difficult to find a buyer.
p300_177|It shows that we are civilised society.
p300_178|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p300_179|I came home by ambulance.
p300_180|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p300_181|This was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
p300_182|She is living proof of their expertise.
p300_183|This one was my best chance.
p300_184|We believe a third party was involved.
p300_185|I am writing a novel.
p300_186|A bit of match fitness is required.
p300_187|All were paid by the taxpayer.
p300_188|The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
p300_189|It was located on the remote control.
p300_190|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
p300_191|Twaddle is a case in point.
p300_192|These elements are not in the book.
p300_193|You look at them and you understand.
p300_194|I am considered a teenager.
p300_195|I would like Glasgow.
p300_196|The FBI could become involved.
p300_197|We have only nine months to go.
p300_198|Both of them have looked good.
p300_199|I like footballers who play well.
p300_200|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p300_201|The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
p300_202|Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
p300_203|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
p300_204|Donald was a man with many friends.
p300_205|We played them off the pitch.
p300_206|It is turning that way all across Europe.
p300_207|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p300_208|We were on top and could've won.
p300_209|That night was a terrible muddle.
p300_210|The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
p300_211|He ended up a headmaster.
p300_212|He was too good for me - too consistent.
p300_213|It is like being a qualifier again.
p300_214|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p300_215|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p300_216|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
p300_217|I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
p300_218|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
p300_219|I might get an injury very easily.
p300_220|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p300_221|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p300_222|That was a stunning drive from Jon.
p300_223|She didn't tell us anything new.
p300_224|There is nothing like this back home.
p300_225|And that gives a kind of freedom.
p300_226|I found a fault and it worked at it.
p300_227|It was a poor performance.
p300_228|They may yet have the last laugh.
p300_229|You can feel at home in China.
p300_230|This is all part of opening the door.
p300_231|We have tried to keep his head up.
p300_232|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
p300_233|He will become the sovereign.
p300_234|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p300_235|Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
p300_236|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
p300_237|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p300_238|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p300_239|It's just gotten too big.
p300_240|Was all this really just five months ago?
p300_241|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p300_242|They were two different types.
p300_243|It need not be like that.
p300_244|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
p300_245|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p300_246|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p300_247|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
p300_248|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p300_249|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p300_250|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p300_251|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p300_252|I just saw them for a few minutes.
p300_253|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
p300_254|People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
p300_255|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p300_256|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p300_257|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
p300_258|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
p300_259|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p300_260|He must have something up his sleeve.
p300_261|If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
p300_262|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
p300_263|That means no more taxation by stealth.
p300_264|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
p300_265|Holland won by five wickets.
p300_266|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
p300_267|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
p300_268|Once they go away they won't come back.
p300_269|THE best marriages are made in heaven.
p300_270|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
p300_271|It is worse because she suffers from angina.
p300_272|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p300_273|The board has rejected her proposals.
p300_274|It does not move, which is amazing.
p300_275|She is a very lucky young lady.
p300_276|The threat to rural areas is real.
p300_277|Tourism continues to struggle.
p300_278|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
p300_279|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
p300_280|THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
p300_281|This is a great shame.
p300_282|That was merely their initial problem.
p300_283|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
p300_284|We said, What do you mean?
p300_285|I need them to set my career.
p300_286|The law will take its course.
p300_287|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
p300_288|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
p300_289|The fund has three elements.
p300_290|This is still a young team, you know.
p300_291|It's not even finished.
p300_292|Everyone knew where they were.
p300_293|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
p300_294|In the old days, it was easy.
p300_295|People will make up their own minds.
p300_296|After that he became more romantic.
p300_297|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p300_298|My view has now completely changed.
p300_299|They finished second and third.
p300_300|We agreed to disagree.
p300_301|He was then replaced by Ross.
p300_302|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
p300_303|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p300_304|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p300_305|People can get them if they want.
p300_306|Their message was simple.
p300_307|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p300_308|He is a law unto himself.
p300_309|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p300_310|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
p300_311|An aide was constructed to get a copy.
p300_312|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p300_313|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
p300_314|It is just completely erased.
p300_315|A great deal has been achieved.
p300_316|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p300_317|I enjoy playing with both of them.
p300_318|Too often it is not.
p300_319|I tend not to look back.
p300_320|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p300_321|I got a yellow card.
p300_322|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
p300_323|I don't know what he was capable of.
p300_324|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
p300_325|It's good to start with Judith.
p300_326|She is now on the back benches.
p300_327|It may also be her last.
p300_328|Maybe it helps us.
p300_329|Three bystanders were killed.
p300_330|She should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p300_331|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p300_332|He made no big mistakes.
p300_333|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p300_334|We will be homeless.
p300_335|I believe he can do a better job.
p300_336|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p300_337|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p300_338|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p300_339|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p300_340|Well, was it?
p300_341|We won't let you down.
p300_342|What kind of person is he?
p300_343|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
p300_344|He was visited by UK consular officials.
p300_345|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
p300_346|English is the language of pop music.
p300_347|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p300_348|It is a simple equation.
p300_349|She has seen, or heard, it all.
p300_350|Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
p300_351|This time, however, there is a new venue.
p300_352|Who has the second highest?
p300_354|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
p300_355|I didn't even have the first idea.
p300_356|No person was charged.
p300_357|I've only met him three times.
p300_358|You see, my back has gone.
p300_359|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p300_360|She looked very, very poor.
p300_361|Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
p300_362|Butcher has only one idea in mind.
p300_363|This is not great, but it goes well.
p300_364|It's an hour of the same response.
p300_365|Both are national treasures.
p300_366|And here is the rub.
p300_367|They are also exploited by the markets.
p300_368|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p300_369|I am really looking forward to it.
p300_370|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
p300_371|This takes the pressure off.
p300_372|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p300_373|I will never get over his death.
p300_374|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p300_375|We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
p300_376|The mix with Tiger is perfect.
p300_377|Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
p300_378|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
p300_379|They should have some measure of protection.
p300_380|They did not threaten anyone.
p301_001|Please call Stella.
p301_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p301_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p301_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p301_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p301_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p301_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p301_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p301_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p301_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p301_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p301_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p301_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p301_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p301_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p301_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p301_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p301_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p301_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p301_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p301_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p301_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p301_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p301_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p301_025|But it was a great decision he joked.
p301_026|They changed the world of music.
p301_027|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p301_028|The law has got to be upheld.
p301_029|But we're not the same person.
p301_030|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
p301_031|I saw the explosion and panicked.
p301_032|The punishment was swift.
p301_033|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p301_034|I kept my side of the bargain.
p301_035|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p301_036|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p301_037|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p301_038|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p301_039|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p301_040|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p301_041|It doesn't make them evil.
p301_042|I have played really well all year.
p301_043|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
p301_044|Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
p301_045|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
p301_046|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p301_047|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p301_048|I try not to expect anything.
p301_049|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p301_050|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p301_051|It was, however, the wrong side.
p301_052|She is now planning a visit.
p301_053|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p301_054|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p301_055|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p301_056|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p301_057|I keep my fingers crossed.
p301_058|The encounter was to change his life.
p301_059|It's the best of both worlds.
p301_060|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p301_061|That is why we want this decision reversed.
p301_062|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p301_063|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
p301_064|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
p301_065|After this, the exercise was due to begin.
p301_066|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
p301_067|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p301_068|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
p301_069|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p301_070|When he took over it really took off.
p301_071|That's just the way the game is evolving.
p301_072|Michael is putting on a brave face.
p301_073|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p301_074|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
p301_075|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p301_076|This is a mental challenge.
p301_077|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p301_078|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
p301_079|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p301_080|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p301_081|He came in an army uniform.
p301_082|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
p301_083|Cars are great for going long distances.
p301_084|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p301_085|I knew he would play two weeks ago.
p301_086|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
p301_087|It has never been worthwhile.
p301_088|So other options had to be explored.
p301_089|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p301_090|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
p301_091|People love to see this stuff.
p301_092|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
p301_093|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p301_094|His female companion was being treated for shock.
p301_095|I have no plans to change the oath.
p301_096|We did not even get a free kick.
p301_097|He was married with a young child.
p301_098|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p301_099|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
p301_100|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p301_101|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p301_102|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p301_103|I am very sorry to be here.
p301_104|I needed a change, a new challenge.
p301_105|Is your life a little too easy?
p301_106|I think my game is suited to grass.
p301_107|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
p301_108|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
p301_109|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p301_110|People want to see me on the screen.
p301_111|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p301_112|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p301_113|The conversion didn't go over either.
p301_114|He took away my childhood.
p301_115|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p301_116|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p301_117|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p301_118|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p301_119|It is not great art.
p301_120|You do not change overnight.
p301_121|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p301_122|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p301_123|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p301_124|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p301_125|We aim to put them out of business.
p301_126|Tony Blair should get out more.
p301_127|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p301_128|He was just awesome.
p301_129|We now have to concentrate on the league.
p301_130|We need to move forward together.
p301_131|She died in hospital two hours later.
p301_132|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
p301_133|Both were later released after a check-up.
p301_134|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
p301_135|How good is Lennox Lewis?
p301_136|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p301_137|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p301_138|The son has autism and other problems.
p301_139|I'm very puzzled by it.
p301_140|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p301_141|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
p301_142|We are both very confused and extremely angry.
p301_143|All things are possible if you believe.
p301_144|This was not just incongruous.
p301_145|It is patently true.
p301_146|You hope he prevails.
p301_147|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p301_148|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
p301_149|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
p301_150|But it looks good for next year.
p301_151|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
p301_152|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p301_153|He was forced to quit.
p301_154|It is good for their eyesight.
p301_155|I was loving that little girl.
p301_156|But you can't have it both ways.
p301_157|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
p301_158|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p301_159|The death toll included five children.
p301_160|Before the game we went for a pint.
p301_161|There is no credible official announcement.
p301_162|I understand the medical concerns.
p301_163|This is a United Kingdom.
p301_164|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p301_165|I am aware that somebody made a threat.
p301_166|However, who could have predicted this result?
p301_167|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p301_168|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p301_169|They were behind the wheel.
p301_170|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p301_171|The problem arises because he does so much.
p301_172|The answer is mayhem.
p301_173|Our young people are leaving.
p301_174|What, then, is the real thing?
p301_175|I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
p301_176|That will be the sweetness.
p301_177|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
p301_178|The big issue for us is the review.
p301_179|There was a fossil on screen.
p301_180|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
p301_181|This does not create any precedent.
p301_182|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
p301_183|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p301_184|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p301_185|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p301_186|The early evidence suggests he did not.
p301_187|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p301_188|I hope you miss the cut.
p301_189|The role was perfect for Russell.
p301_190|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
p301_191|We are seeking funds from government departments.
p301_192|That, though, was again according to manager McCall.
p301_193|He scored one goal and was on fire.
p301_194|I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
p301_195|Harold is a rarity.
p301_196|Walk out the door and anything can happen.
p301_197|I want him to take on Gomez.
p301_198|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p301_199|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p301_200|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p301_201|Well, what do you know?
p301_202|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p301_203|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p301_204|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p301_205|He will emerge as a world leader.
p301_206|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p301_207|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p301_208|We have no choice but to shut down.
p301_209|The prognosis is excellent.
p301_210|They always want to give a performance.
p301_211|But he just carried on anyway.
p301_212|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p301_213|I would not want to be young again.
p301_214|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p301_215|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p301_216|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p301_217|They were later discharged from hospital.
p301_218|These findings would be made public.
p301_219|What are you not good at?
p301_220|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p301_221|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
p301_222|This makes no sense!
p301_223|I go home only once.
p301_224|It had a gigantic effect.
p301_225|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p301_226|If not, a deal could take many months.
p301_227|The team this year is going places.
p301_228|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
p301_229|It took more than two years.
p301_230|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
p301_231|He said because people had invited him.
p301_232|That's the key issue isn't it?
p301_233|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
p301_234|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p301_235|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p301_236|I came up through the ranks.
p301_237|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p301_238|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p301_239|These guys will not lie down.
p301_240|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p301_241|That is nearly four people every day.
p301_242|There are nine people here now.
p301_243|His son is a local legend.
p301_244|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p301_245|Which perhaps is just as well.
p301_246|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p301_247|He would just say it was terrible.
p301_248|This is the New Edinburgh.
p301_249|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p301_250|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
p301_251|We kept going right to the final whistle.
p301_252|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p301_253|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p301_254|The final stage is paranoia.
p301_255|I am not holding the club to ransom.
p301_256|Wagner was never like this.
p301_257|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p301_258|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p301_259|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
p301_260|That's the sort of game you want.
p301_261|We're not travel agents.
p301_262|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p301_263|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p301_264|It's the same old story.
p301_265|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p301_266|It was a moment of madness.
p301_267|I do not own the vessel in question.
p301_268|Racism has no place in any sport.
p301_269|I am not happy with proposals for widows.
p301_270|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
p301_271|Bombing is the easy option.
p301_272|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p301_273|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p301_274|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p301_275|I'd say we should give it a week.
p301_276|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p301_277|Little Voice is on general release.
p301_278|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p301_279|There is no substitute.
p301_280|That nation is South Africa.
p301_281|This will secure the future of our industry.
p301_282|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p301_283|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p301_284|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p301_285|It was an empowering journey.
p301_286|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p301_287|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
p301_288|They had been together for about three years.
p301_289|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
p301_290|Everything has been destroyed.
p301_291|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
p301_292|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
p301_293|We just want to get stuck in now.
p301_294|Do you come from Moscow?
p301_295|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p301_296|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p301_297|They are the innocent victims.
p301_298|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p301_299|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p301_300|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p301_301|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p301_302|Broke the birdie record.
p301_303|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p301_304|They tried to give her advice.
p301_305|That it is a brand name.
p301_306|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p301_307|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p301_308|They will have to make changes.
p301_309|This fact is supported by audience research.
p301_310|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p301_311|Both sides have to step back.
p301_312|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p301_313|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p301_314|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
p301_315|We are ready for the long haul.
p301_316|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p301_317|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p301_318|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p301_319|EMI is a prime example.
p301_320|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p301_321|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p301_322|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p301_323|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p301_324|A friendship that will endure.
p301_325|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p301_326|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p301_327|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p301_328|He is young but not too young.
p301_329|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p301_330|It will also take evidence from consumers.
p301_331|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p301_332|I am not obsessed with sex.
p301_333|They've been at it for five hours.
p301_334|There is no answer to it.
p301_335|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p301_336|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p301_337|His English counterpart agreed.
p301_338|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p301_339|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p301_340|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
p301_341|I am not putting myself down.
p301_342|He's a joy to follow.
p301_343|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p301_344|We were lucky to have survived.
p301_345|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p301_346|At this level, you have all to perform well.
p301_347|I just want to change my life.
p301_348|He did not oppose the divorce.
p301_349|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p301_350|And Michael was just great.
p301_351|He knew it would cost him millions.
p301_352|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p301_353|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p301_354|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
p301_355|That only came out during a radio interview.
p301_356|We are now setting about finding them.
p301_357|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p301_358|We must not go down that road.
p301_359|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p301_360|I am not among its admirers.
p301_361|And that match was played in June.
p301_362|He will address the nation this evening.
p301_363|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p301_364|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p301_365|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p301_366|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p301_367|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p301_368|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p301_369|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p301_370|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p301_371|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p301_372|His job was not advertised.
p301_373|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p301_374|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p301_375|He has changed my life for ever.
p301_376|The home was now under new management.
p301_377|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p301_378|There is no openness.
p301_379|It's being very carefully looked at.
p301_380|It was a job he loved.
p301_381|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p301_382|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p301_383|Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
p301_384|It looks like paradise.
p301_385|At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
p301_386|We were short of athletes.
p301_387|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p301_388|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p301_389|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p301_390|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p301_391|I had no qualms about it.
p302_001|Please call Stella.
p302_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p302_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p302_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p302_005|She can spoon these things into her three bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p302_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p302_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p302_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p302_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p302_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p302_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p302_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p302_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p302_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p302_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the god to foretell war or heavy rain.
p302_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p302_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p302_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p302_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p302_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p302_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
p302_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
p302_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green yellow light when mixed form yellow.
p302_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p302_025|It does make a big difference.
p302_026|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p302_027|Each one has its own system.
p302_028|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p302_029|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p302_030|It is a very special city.
p302_031|It has been blown out of all proportion.
p302_032|He's not very big, either.
p302_033|I've taken to the hills.
p302_034|My game is in pretty good shape.
p302_035|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p302_036|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p302_037|We used to keep our business rates.
p302_038|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p302_039|All of us do.
p302_040|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p302_041|It could have been just a quick fix.
p302_042|We are looking for volunteers.
p302_043|Theatre is not a museum.
p302_044|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p302_045|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p302_046|He could face a jail sentence.
p302_047|They don't take you to mass graves.
p302_048|What's it got to do with art?
p302_049|Happily we found it in the library.
p302_050|I know a lot of people who don't.
p302_051|There was nobody on the roof.
p302_052|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p302_053|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p302_054|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p302_055|The days of empty promises are over.
p302_056|Henry was strong and talented.
p302_057|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p302_058|We must improve our relations with the government.
p302_059|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p302_060|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p302_061|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p302_062|He said it was the worst possible result.
p302_063|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p302_064|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p302_065|It is just part of modern day life.
p302_066|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p302_067|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p302_068|YOU thought it was a headache.
p302_069|I hope we can put it behind us.
p302_070|But it was to no avail.
p302_071|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p302_072|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p302_073|That alibi is now gone.
p302_074|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p302_075|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p302_076|You do have a way out.
p302_077|It is simple, really.
p302_078|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p302_079|I was in jail for five years.
p302_080|You, the British people, are the boss.
p302_081|A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
p302_082|PR for Westminister is their holy grail.
p302_083|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p302_084|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p302_085|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p302_086|She could easily have been killed.
p302_087|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p302_088|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p302_089|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p302_090|The same goes for personnel.
p302_091|He was a crazy man.
p302_092|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
p302_093|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p302_094|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p302_095|There was an element of jealousy.
p302_096|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p302_097|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p302_098|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p302_099|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p302_100|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p302_101|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p302_102|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
p302_103|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p302_104|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p302_105|It separates the men from the boys.
p302_106|But the attachment took a lot of growing.
p302_107|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p302_108|Two and a half million people have died.
p302_109|Or so it would appear.
p302_110|I hope they understand that.
p302_111|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p302_112|She will also get a pay rise.
p302_114|It is time for a more honest approach.
p302_115|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p302_116|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p302_117|I want to play at the highest level.
p302_118|Stalkers are capable of killing.
p302_119|It ignores the future.
p302_120|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p302_121|The trial is set for February.
p302_122|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p302_123|Do not go into government buildings.
p302_124|There is only one caveat.
p302_125|We are still getting signals.
p302_126|And perhaps it is as simple as that.
p302_127|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p302_128|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p302_129|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p302_130|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p302_131|I heard some of his remarks.
p302_132|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p302_133|I was just overwhelmed.
p302_134|It has been in place since last July.
p302_135|The European Court is our only option.
p302_136|Do you think they would be any better?
p302_137|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p302_138|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p302_139|The singer's condition was not specified.
p302_140|How much of a cop out is that?
p302_141|The whole region is in shock.
p302_142|It will be the final push.
p302_143|Lord Levy said he'd started his life with nothing.
p302_144|You were the kidnappers.
p302_145|It is a very interesting subject.
p302_146|The women were on their way home yesterday.
p302_147|I could feel the blood on my face.
p302_148|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p302_149|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p302_150|Debbie Harry was cool.
p302_151|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p302_152|That sort of thing is long gone.
p302_153|I'm afraid to say anything.
p302_154|I know you went back this morning.
p302_155|We did not want an absentee landlord.
p302_156|These men could be anywhere in the world.
p302_157|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
p302_158|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p302_159|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p302_160|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p302_161|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p302_162|The red card was okay.
p302_163|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p302_164|But they will not be compelled to join.
p302_165|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p302_166|I was doing well at the hustings.
p302_167|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p302_168|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p302_169|We must put a marker down.
p302_170|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p302_171|There is no date on this document.
p302_172|And now he tells us.
p302_173|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p302_174|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p302_175|It is time to come into the limelight.
p302_176|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p302_177|His name is Michael Owen.
p302_179|I will have to order its destruction.
p302_180|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p302_181|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p302_182|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p302_183|Smith has not let him down.
p302_184|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p302_185|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
p302_186|They have two children.
p302_187|Luckily, our patient was stable.
p302_188|I'm really proud of my young players.
p302_189|People buy everything with cash.
p302_190|There was great support all round the route.
p302_191|It's amazing it happened in daytime.
p302_192|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p302_193|Scottish fishermen comended the decision.
p302_194|Or so we have long assumed.
p302_195|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p302_196|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p302_197|It's not just for classical music.
p302_198|This must be kept in total perspective.
p302_199|All the names are familiar to me.
p302_200|They had not been handcuffed.
p302_201|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p302_202|I've never been limited on drugs.
p302_203|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p302_204|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p302_205|We have chosen for the patients.
p302_206|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p302_207|Why should we even be asked to share?
p302_208|Which means it matters.
p302_209|There is a great potential on this river.
p302_210|I was surprised by his response.
p302_211|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p302_212|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p302_213|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p302_214|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p302_215|Is this accurate?
p302_216|A judicial review is also being considered.
p302_217|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p302_218|They could go no further forward.
p302_219|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p302_220|Appointed general secretary last September.
p302_221|They make it look very easy.
p302_222|It was a total surprise.
p302_223|I had enough on.
p302_224|And we're not there yet.
p302_225|No meaningful response was issued.
p302_226|It is a form of physical exercise.
p302_227|plays in dark blue.
p302_228|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
p302_229|It is something that we will put right.
p302_230|Survival is our aim.
p302_231|There is no reason at all.
p302_232|This is her first senior Scottish selection.
p302_233|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p302_234|I'm pleased with the horse.
p302_235|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
p302_236|This is a club on the rise.
p302_237|I had a sense of deja vu.
p302_238|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p302_239|They follow him everywhere.
p302_240|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p302_241|There was no safety net.
p302_242|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
p302_243|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
p302_244|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
p302_245|Mr Miller is married with three children.
p302_246|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p302_247|We have great sympathy with Danny.
p302_248|He should be a great asset.
p302_249|It means they actually control the programme.
p302_250|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p302_251|We are not out of touch with politics.
p302_252|We could have got three medals.
p302_253|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p302_254|We are at a crossroads.
p302_255|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p302_257|It didn't take long.
p302_258|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p302_259|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p302_260|I started on a fire a couple of times.
p302_261|He also received a medal of honour.
p302_262|It's not one for the purists.
p302_263|She said he showed no remorse.
p302_264|I'm a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p302_265|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p302_266|It is a time bomb.
p302_267|It's a matter of huge concern.
p302_268|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p302_269|Three years probation is just a joke.
p302_270|The outstanding issues are still there.
p302_271|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p302_272|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
p302_274|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
p302_275|That got me out of jail.
p302_276|We have turned the corner.
p302_277|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
p302_278|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p302_279|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p302_280|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p302_281|We have taken steps to rectify it.
p302_282|I see no need for change.
p302_283|Do yourselves a favour.
p302_284|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p302_285|Others said they had been beaten by police.
p302_286|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p302_287|I'd love to be like Peter.
p302_288|They came into collision with Sergio.
p302_289|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p302_290|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p302_291|He is a success story by any standard.
p302_292|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p302_293|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p302_294|Is something which we just don't do.
p302_295|We work on the same level.
p302_296|I've got a young family.
p303_001|Please call Stella.
p303_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p303_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p303_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p303_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p303_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p303_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p303_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p303_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.

p303_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p303_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p303_025|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
p303_026|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p303_027|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
p303_028|That is just a load of baloney.
p303_029|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p303_030|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
p303_031|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p303_032|The feeling is marvellous.
p303_033|I think they should have more respect.
p303_034|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p303_035|They are interior designers and architects.
p303_036|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p303_037|Others may be trying to catch up.
p303_038|It was a crucial moment.
p303_039|We gave everything we had.
p303_040|I let go the telephone and ran.
p303_041|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
p303_042|His charisma is all on the course.
p303_043|This is purely financial.
p303_044|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p303_045|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p303_046|I did not want any damage to us.
p303_047|It was an easy decision to come here.
p303_048|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
p303_049|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
p303_050|I saw them not long after it happened.
p303_051|This guy is never going to give up.
p303_052|Who said impatience is a virtue?
p303_053|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p303_054|You've got to have everything inside with you.
p303_055|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
p303_056|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p303_057|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p303_058|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p303_059|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p303_060|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p303_061|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p303_062|Don't say you have not been warned.
p303_063|That is a mark of what you are.
p303_064|Seven children had lost both parents.
p303_065|It is par for the course, isn't it?
p303_066|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
p303_067|Most people know that.
p303_068|Some people still think she should be English.
p303_069|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p303_070|Repayment is not part of the game.
p303_071|The cause of the crash was unclear.
p303_072|What do they pay to join the club?
p303_073|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
p303_074|We are now in a safe place.
p303_075|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
p303_076|It will be very useful for us.
p303_077|He was obviously very genuine.
p303_078|We just try to make great records.
p303_079|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p303_080|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p303_081|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
p303_082|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p303_083|His parenthood is called into question.
p303_084|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p303_085|We really need research to help with that.
p303_086|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p303_087|There were no passengers on board.
p303_088|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
p303_089|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
p303_090|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p303_091|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p303_092|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p303_093|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p303_094|Scotland were beaten again.
p303_095|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p303_096|The League of Nations was also his idea.
p303_097|I've done it almost like a variety show.
p303_098|She is on a life support machine.
p303_099|Their vision was not impeded.
p303_100|Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
p303_101|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p303_102|Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
p303_103|He went to see what he could learn.
p303_104|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
p303_105|Referees are easy targets.
p303_106|The luxury has been well used.
p303_107|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p303_108|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p303_109|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p303_110|There was no time scale.
p303_111|Only the scale of change differed.
p303_112|Tell you the team he picked?
p303_113|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p303_114|The cold war is over.
p303_115|I'd like to take the plunge.
p303_116|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p303_117|And it's more subversive.
p303_118|We are losing this war.
p303_119|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p303_120|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p303_121|They will know they deserve to be there.
p303_122|I've got no secret.
p303_123|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p303_124|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p303_125|I asked why he had come.
p303_126|Will they ever reopen?
p303_127|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p303_128|A lot of people were in tears.
p303_129|We have great team spirit.
p303_130|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p303_131|He loves the big occasions.
p303_132|They should take their mobile phones.
p303_133|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p303_134|We have big ideas.
p303_135|I first met him last summer.
p303_136|It was to be published next month.
p303_137|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p303_138|It could have been a hammering by now.
p303_139|Subs not used, Fernandez.
p303_140|I played really well on the back nine.
p303_141|It's a bit like a bereavement.
p303_142|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
p303_143|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
p303_144|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
p303_145|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p303_146|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
p303_147|I always knew she was funny.
p303_148|All kinds of things occur.
p303_149|I expected these kind of questions.
p303_150|It was fit for royalty.
p303_151|It is always the same, isn't it?
p303_152|Who would take it now, after all this?
p303_153|I felt really good until Friday.
p303_154|That gives us something to kick against.
p303_155|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p303_156|Equity declined to comment.
p303_157|There is precious little middle ground.
p303_158|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
p303_159|The inquiry had been going on for months.
p303_160|They were both delightful to work with.
p303_161|It's my delight on a shiny night.
p303_162|I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.
p303_163|It's now down in black and white.
p303_164|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p303_165|It is quite an eye opener.
p303_166|Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.
p303_167|What, they maybe have three Scottish players?
p303_168|Can they be serious?
p303_169|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
p303_170|That, in our view, is an important decision.
p303_171|It's just that we see different things.
p303_172|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p303_173|We're all family men with children.
p303_174|I think we showed that after half time.
p303_175|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p303_176|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
p303_177|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
p303_178|You let a lot of people down.
p303_179|One person was believed to have been hit.
p303_180|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
p303_181|We aren't going to play better.
p303_182|They just would not have run away.
p303_183|Two men have been charged with his murder.
p303_184|Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
p303_185|The guys have really enjoyed it.
p303_186|Charles Clarke is an idiot.
p303_187|Our people should be immune.
p303_188|Glasgow then took control.
p303_189|It is simple and easy to use.
p303_190|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
p303_191|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p303_192|I think we finished fifth.
p303_193|It was not a foul.
p303_194|We know them as mobile telephones.
p303_195|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
p303_196|I don't know exactly what happened.
p303_197|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p303_198|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p303_199|The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
p303_200|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
p303_201|It was a very difficult decision for us.
p303_202|I am not a happy man.
p303_203|You can be sure we will have problems.
p303_204|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p303_205|I'm going with all three.
p303_206|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
p303_207|The line-up is a tasty one.
p303_208|I don't honestly know how to describe it.
p303_209|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p303_210|He had taken everything from me.
p303_211|Many, many people don't know who he is.
p303_212|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
p303_213|They should also have the right to vote.
p303_214|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
p303_215|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
p303_216|People are so negative about the whole business.
p303_217|They had given up on him.
p303_218|We didn't know if people would turn up.
p303_219|It has made me feel good.
p303_220|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
p303_221|We have our supporters and our enemies.
p303_222|She has now been registered as disabled.
p303_223|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p303_224|I was living with my mum.
p303_225|It did my image a lot of good!
p303_226|This Government believes in parental discipline.
p303_227|It's been a long, long journey.
p303_228|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p303_229|But there has never been the time, she said.
p303_230|This could be one such case, he declared.
p303_231|I fell in love with ballet.
p303_232|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p303_233|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p303_234|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p303_235|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p303_236|We're still talking with a few people.
p303_237|But one shouldn't go by that.
p303_238|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p303_239|I think in three dimensions.
p303_240|They had four children together.
p303_241|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
p303_242|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
p303_243|How can they engage with the work?
p303_244|All were later allowed home.
p303_245|She has a wonderful mind.
p303_246|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p303_247|We're into that build-up now.
p303_248|It is the end of an era.
p303_249|We can just get on with our game.
p303_250|But first it goes out on TV.
p303_251|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
p303_252|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
p303_253|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p303_254|I learned a lot from her.
p303_255|We have reacted well to each other.
p303_256|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p303_257|They seem to be backing off from that.
p303_258|They have a very good method of working.
p303_259|Do you think you have a shot?
p303_260|I believe we have a good chance.
p303_261|Things were not easy from the outset.
p303_262|She may even appear in some more films.
p303_263|We've had great things in the past.
p303_264|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p303_265|I've seen some of the submissions.
p303_266|There is no such thing.
p303_267|I feel very strongly about that.
p303_268|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p303_269|After that nothing could save him.
p303_270|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p303_271|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p303_272|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p303_273|It is now very clear that that doesn't work.
p303_274|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p303_275|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p303_276|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p303_277|Last year, however, was a different story.
p303_278|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p303_279|I bought a car at auction.
p303_280|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p303_281|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p303_282|She had been sexually assaulted.
p303_283|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p303_284|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
p303_285|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p303_286|We have been treated with complete contempt.
p303_287|There is no smoking gun.
p303_288|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
p303_289|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
p303_290|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p303_291|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p303_292|I have been coming here for nine years.
p303_293|I felt under no pressure today.
p303_294|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p303_295|And that was the adults.
p303_296|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p303_297|That is a job for the Government.
p303_298|I felt the head was very like me.
p303_299|And he had much need.
p303_300|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p303_301|This can only help us go forward.
p303_302|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p303_303|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p303_304|Andrew McLellan is no exception.
p303_305|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p303_306|Some have other commitments.
p303_307|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p303_308|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p303_309|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p303_310|The crowd was awesome.
p303_311|That was moving the goalposts.
p303_312|We have the location, which is assured.
p303_313|Rapid revision was required.
p303_314|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p303_315|We couldn't go very fast.
p303_316|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p303_317|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p303_318|We have grown up in Britain.
p303_319|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p303_320|I am proud of those guys.
p303_321|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p303_322|It is too early to speculate.
p303_323|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p303_324|I'll go out and be aggressive.
p303_325|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p303_326|What is the truth about the cow?
p303_327|They will want to watch a winning team.
p303_328|Who is going to be penalised?
p303_329|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p303_330|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p303_331|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p303_332|I have a theory.
p303_333|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p304_001|Please call Stella.
p304_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p304_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p304_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p304_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p304_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p304_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p304_008|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p304_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p304_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p304_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p304_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p304_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p304_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p304_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p304_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p304_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p304_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p304_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p304_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p304_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p304_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p304_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p304_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p304_025|So we will cut their numbers.
p304_026|Who cares about that?
p304_027|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p304_028|Glasgow is going to be open for business.
p304_029|I know my job.
p304_030|The likelihood is that it will be negative.
p304_031|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p304_032|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p304_033|They agree to meet.
p304_034|SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.
p304_035|But there was a heavy price to pay.
p304_036|The most important thing was to win today.
p304_037|We have a strong team at the moment.
p304_038|At half-time you have?
p304_039|The butcher is very good.
p304_040|He is dying from cancer.
p304_041|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p304_042|It was an ambush.
p304_043|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p304_044|Scottish sport was not mentioned.
p304_045|I was doing a charity concert.
p304_046|You have to have a sense of humour.
p304_047|It is not about changing our image.
p304_048|We are waiting for advice on the film.
p304_049|I hadn't been looking after myself.
p304_050|His father said, My son was lucky.
p304_051|But they also came with a downside.
p304_052|She was only doing her job.
p304_053|Are you listening, All Saints?
p304_054|And then came the seventies.
p304_055|I guess it is down to focus.
p304_056|I'm very angry about it.
p304_057|I have great respect for all my players.
p304_058|His track record is not promising.
p304_059|For a moment it was all about her.
p304_060|Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
p304_061|Trading Places was too obvious.
p304_062|They don't know how to do it.
p304_063|No details were disclosed.
p304_064|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
p304_065|If you can get away with it, you do it.
p304_066|First is open defiance.
p304_067|You probably have never seen them before.
p304_068|Clearly, audiences are unsettled.
p304_069|We have avoided that at least.
p304_070|I love a clever reader.
p304_071|I do not believe they are.
p304_072|That is completely against Islam.
p304_073|Clearly, there will have to be changes.
p304_074|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p304_075|I will wait until later.
p304_076|But, of course, it isn't.
p304_077|We are almost at that point, but not quite.
p304_078|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p304_079|Could it be?
p304_080|It is bad news for us and England.
p304_081|They had failed to explode.
p304_082|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
p304_083|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
p304_084|Nor should there have been.
p304_085|Smoking is also very important.
p304_086|I have a theory.
p304_087|He was determined to write a novel.
p304_088|So is there anything left to say?
p304_089|My back is feeling really good.
p304_090|They've got their own agenda.
p304_091|This commitment should be built upon.
p304_092|It was one he was born to play.
p304_093|But we are losing that connection.
p304_094|He was jailed for five years.
p304_095|I am about protecting the state pension.
p304_096|We will look into it.
p304_097|But he's not afraid to take risks.
p304_098|We shouldn't have a rush to judgment.
p304_099|I live on the streets of Glasgow.
p304_100|Did you get the script?
p304_101|This is an exciting time in Scottish politics.
p304_102|There, you were just a body.
p304_103|He will suspend it on Thursday afternoon.
p304_104|Four people died instantly.
p304_105|He did not know his daughter.
p304_106|Jim Wallace has been running the Government.
p304_107|Our children are the future of our society.
p304_108|Nine other passengers were treated at the scene.
p304_109|I can't believe it's all gone.
p304_110|I am just going to go for it.
p304_111|We will meet again.
p304_112|We are about to have our own Parliament.
p304_113|Part of the complex is historic.
p304_114|We need to chat.
p304_115|Justice was not seen today.
p304_116|Among them are many criminals.
p304_117|This is not about revenge.
p304_118|How can we ignore it?
p304_119|It's totally double standards.
p304_120|Strikers like to go to the ground.
p304_121|It's something he works hard at achieving.
p304_122|We are taking the back seat on this.
p304_123|It was a privilege to work for him.
p304_124|But he admits he is deeply upset.
p304_125|We told them in August.
p304_126|We are going to have a parade.
p304_127|That could be at least five years away.
p304_128|That is my role.
p304_129|Everyone can be bought.
p304_130|You would be a fool not to listen.
p304_131|No other offers apply.
p304_132|Have you noticed?
p304_133|This is a wonderful honour for me.
p304_134|The Lobby is not failing.
p304_135|It was a takeover.
p304_136|That statement has never been withdrawn.
p304_137|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p304_138|How many cases have there been?
p304_139|But we have to plan for the future.
p304_140|And yet his legacy is doubtful.
p304_141|This advice was accepted by ministers.
p304_142|That's a pretty good percentage.
p304_143|I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
p304_144|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p304_145|You have to think not.
p304_146|This is a total mystery.
p304_147|They were due to have begun today.
p304_148|Do not listen to them.
p304_149|So what makes it so special?
p304_150|It will be easier for us.
p304_151|I'm pleased for him.
p304_152|The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
p304_153|You need a trademark.
p304_154|This is our Olympics.
p304_155|Things are looking pretty positive at the moment.
p304_156|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p304_157|My goal was very important to the team.
p304_158|There are plenty examples.
p304_159|This is not a Scottish problem.
p304_160|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p304_161|I have worked with him on projects.
p304_162|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
p304_163|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p304_164|And there is no cause for it.
p304_165|I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
p304_166|What has changed?
p304_167|Manchester United were still trying up to yesterday.
p304_168|It is a symbolic concert.
p304_169|He asked me how they were doing.
p304_170|They would have looked out for each other.
p304_171|I've got three other ideas for the day.
p304_172|Well it had to be something, that's for sure.
p304_174|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p304_175|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p304_176|The result today is an impasse.
p304_177|Nelson does not disappoint.
p304_178|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p304_179|The real world is full of competing causes.
p304_180|They've got to decide to do that.
p304_181|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
p304_182|These are terrible offences.
p304_183|This is it finally finished.
p304_184|An announcement is expected today on their future.
p304_185|There were so many characters among them.
p304_186|Or is it the European approach?
p304_187|We could not get any possession.
p304_188|Did you see that?
p304_189|The cost of war is more than that.
p304_190|I saw the whole thing.
p304_191|There is a demand for another hospice.
p304_192|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p304_193|Then they were awarded a penalty.
p304_194|Journalists should make him.
p304_195|They will have five minutes to decide.
p304_196|I see that any day now.
p304_197|But who knows?
p304_198|He was tough and relentless.
p304_199|That would be unlawful.
p304_200|This guy is amazing.
p304_201|The same goes for McKenna.
p304_202|That is no use.
p304_203|They will want to perform well.
p304_204|We should not worry about other players.
p304_205|Ownership was the game.
p304_206|Their moment had come, or so they said.
p304_207|I love the moment of being first.
p304_208|Some examples are presented in detail.
p304_209|You cannot understand it until you experience it.
p304_210|Anything that can be done, the Government will do.
p304_211|I sincerely hope that will not change.
p304_212|Just don't go looking to be shocked.
p304_213|It was total confusion.
p304_214|I have learned from him.
p304_215|Pupils will be the losers.
p304_216|The position on the euro remains unchanged.
p304_217|Such actions are rarely popular.
p304_218|That is why it is so lyrical.
p304_219|It isn't a happy memory.
p304_220|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p304_221|Who would be a referee?
p304_222|We have a team to reach the final.
p304_223|We want to be separate from our neighbours.
p304_224|He was correct in everything he did.
p304_225|I see no reason for them to be.
p304_226|I never agreed with that.
p304_227|He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
p304_228|I don't think it is vital.
p304_229|But he insisted that victory was possible.
p304_230|That could run into millions.
p304_231|It might not survive the process.
p304_232|The truth is, it is somewhere in the middle.
p304_233|I'm really excited about the album.
p304_234|We were desperate to get the game on.
p304_235|But there is a possible place.
p304_236|You can't have it both ways.
p304_237|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p304_238|But they will need to play to score.
p304_239|He is a joy to watch.
p304_240|They also have good neighbours.
p304_241|We are now open.
p304_242|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p304_243|There is no pressure from anyone now.
p304_244|Now it has become a big picture.
p304_245|We want to learn lessons from that.
p304_246|He can perform well under pressure.
p304_247|I've enjoyed the whole experience.
p304_248|He was totally without that form of fear.
p304_249|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
p304_250|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
p304_251|They have the cash to do that.
p304_252|This is a defining moment in this parliament.
p304_253|He wouldn't have played in all three.
p304_254|And that includes the Barnett formula.
p304_255|It is a great shame.
p304_256|But experts have disputed that statistic.
p304_257|The council has been open and transparent.
p304_258|I'll never think of myself as a star.
p304_259|I felt he was excellent.
p304_260|It was a policy they were against.
p304_261|The results are sometimes contentious.
p304_262|I believe that Scotland has much to gain.
p304_263|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p304_264|Had she enjoyed the experience?
p304_265|He has changed the country itself.
p304_266|The look on his face was something special.
p304_267|I can certainly see much better.
p304_268|We then went to see the headmaster.
p304_269|I needed a little man in the crowd.
p304_270|It would then be up to the judge.
p304_271|Are we going to stay up?
p304_272|People were actually not on his side.
p304_273|It was a very difficult period.
p304_274|It's all going to clear the debt.
p304_275|It used to be less than five minutes.
p304_276|It was by the numbers.
p304_277|My Dad is a hero.
p304_278|It is my fault.
p304_279|We are not asking for the moon.
p304_280|That used to be another thing of mine.
p304_281|At the election we will oppose the euro.
p304_282|As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
p304_283|Teachers have been given the offer.
p304_284|He called for a public inquiry.
p304_285|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p304_286|I played badly, but it happens.
p304_287|I have got a wife to feed.
p304_288|I lost my head.
p304_289|What are the barriers?
p304_290|He is keen to stay in public service.
p304_291|You are not going in blind.
p304_292|You had to go and see him.
p304_293|She says she has grown up.
p304_294|He met his wife and married in England.
p304_295|But it could have been written for her.
p304_296|It makes no sense.
p304_297|What will they called?
p304_298|We come here in peace, for peace.
p304_299|He will feel the pain again.
p304_300|After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
p304_301|I can't stand this sort of stuff.
p304_302|Is Saddam a threat?
p304_303|The jury is still out.
p304_304|Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
p304_305|I can't say that this is very usual.
p304_306|He is married, with two children.
p304_307|At Riverside, the rematch was totally different.
p304_308|We are the gateway to justice.
p304_309|As in battle, the worst thing is waiting for it.
p304_310|We understand the changes in the world.
p304_311|It is a potential factor.
p304_312|The working families tax credit is far better.
p304_313|It added to the reverence.
p304_314|It is too early to say.
p304_315|It's to do with context.
p304_316|David Trimble has sold out.
p304_317|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p304_318|I don't understand it.
p304_319|The teenager had been missing for six months.
p304_320|He was rejected because he had retired.
p304_321|And then we got off the plane.
p304_322|I think it is wide open.
p304_323|I am totally surprised.
p304_324|We are all ecstatic.
p304_325|I hope he has learned from it.
p304_326|That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.
p304_327|You are a gambling man.
p304_328|Who honestly expected anything else?
p304_329|The search has been called off.
p304_330|The matter will come up again.
p304_331|Our strategy is straightforward.
p304_332|Surely this is not supposed to happen?
p304_333|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p304_334|They were unable to revive him.
p304_335|This has come as a shock to everyone.
p304_336|Yes, it was too short a night.
p304_337|It is not for me, though.
p304_338|It really was my favourite.
p304_339|That is why this action has been taken.
p304_340|They should be looking at his victims.
p304_341|There were many positives for this club.
p304_342|It's all about money, money, money.
p304_343|There wasn't anything in it.
p304_344|What do we do for an encore?
p304_345|Things start to talk to each other.
p304_346|I would like to stay with Rangers.
p304_347|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p304_348|Thirty people have applied for his job!
p304_349|That is a lot of writing.
p304_350|There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
p304_351|It is no place for a poet.
p304_352|There is room for me.
p304_353|My life is in the ballet.
p304_354|For next season, we have time to restructure.
p304_355|The truth, of course, is very different.
p304_356|He has something in common with the Wallabies.
p304_357|These will take a little time to develop.
p304_358|This is not a birthday party.
p304_359|Darren is very, very good.
p304_360|It's a drop in the bucket.
p304_361|I've had a hard time, to be honest.
p304_362|I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
p304_363|She is still very poorly.
p304_364|That's how she wants to remember him.
p304_365|There was no disruption to services.
p304_366|We talk about effective military action.
p304_367|It was a discussion paper.
p304_368|My neighbours are horrified.
p304_369|He had no problem with alcohol.
p304_370|This was a very tragic accident.
p304_371|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
p304_372|It is the voice of the survivors.
p304_373|I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
p304_374|I wish him well.
p304_375|Only the details have to be sorted out.
p304_376|They say they feel different.
p304_377|We are in the hat.
p304_378|Well, what can you do?
p304_379|Motorists will welcome this.
p304_380|It is not the message alone.
p304_381|She failed to win any of them.
p304_382|He is at war with his knee.
p304_383|I think we're going to make it.
p304_384|I didn't know where they were.
p304_385|Clubs can only do so much.
p304_386|Many other areas are coming up.
p304_387|But it's a subtle process.
p304_388|But let's not go down that road.
p304_389|It is not attempting to offer a solution.
p304_390|Changes need to be made.
p304_391|I don't care to recall it.
p304_392|That's the way things are heading.
p304_393|Hard it will be.
p304_394|He just attracted people.
p304_395|It was better than a soap opera.
p304_396|I doubt it would be genuine.
p304_397|You must be ready to play anyone.
p304_398|It would have been a very explosive issue.
p304_399|It seems a waste of talents.
p304_400|It is the worst of both worlds.
p304_401|We need to tighten up.
p304_402|His body was never found.
p304_403|Just get on with your job.
p304_404|We expect a full house on the night.
p305_001|Please call Stella.
p305_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p305_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p305_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p305_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p305_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p305_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p305_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p305_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p305_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p305_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p305_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p305_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p305_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p305_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p305_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p305_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p305_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p305_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p305_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p305_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p305_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p305_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p305_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p305_025|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p305_026|He added, however, that all options are under review.
p305_027|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p305_028|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p305_029|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p305_030|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p305_031|I'm happy to contribute to that.
p305_032|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p305_033|We had a reunion last week.
p305_034|We have high hopes that this will work.
p305_035|Everyone around the club was supportive.
p305_036|People ask about the concept of a team.
p305_037|Who has he fought?
p305_038|I want a free vote.
p305_039|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p305_040|It would show them a positive way forward.
p305_041|Players were held in equally low regard.
p305_042|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p305_043|He stands on Centre Court alone.
p305_044|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p305_045|There was a fine line to tread.
p305_046|They receive a high profile in the media.
p305_047|They were urged to get themselves in order.
p305_048|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p305_049|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p305_050|But don't expect an easy ride.
p305_051|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p305_052|Some US embassy staff have left the country.
p305_053|Her mother said she fell off a swing.
p305_054|We see little sign of improvement.
p305_055|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
p305_056|Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
p305_057|For example they could be in school uniform.
p305_058|This film will be totally awesome.
p305_059|Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
p305_060|There is no mandate for a regime change.
p305_061|He did the right thing by ignoring me.
p305_062|That tells you something about them.
p305_063|The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
p305_064|This rule is archaic.
p305_065|I am a drug addict.
p305_066|I've had to take time off work today.
p305_067|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p305_068|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
p305_069|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
p305_070|However, consumers may take a different view.
p305_071|Nancy is not sure how she feels.
p305_072|How do you resurrect a dying town?
p305_073|I've put my own money into this project.
p305_074|I've come here for the jersey.
p305_075|It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
p305_076|I'm so proud of my team.
p305_077|That would open the gates of hell.
p305_078|This has not, and has been neglected.
p305_079|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p305_080|If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
p305_081|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p305_082|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
p305_083|However, it is much bigger than that.
p305_084|This season has been great for me, it's been an experience.
p305_085|The jury is still out.
p305_086|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p305_087|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
p305_088|I drove the ball well.
p305_089|If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
p305_090|His handling raises a wider issue.
p305_091|This is not a recipe for conflict.
p305_092|He had done his homework properly.
p305_093|You've got it coming Kabul.
p305_094|Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
p305_095|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
p305_096|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p305_097|My grandparents were terrified.
p305_098|Are they control freaks?
p305_099|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p305_100|They never looked like winning it either.
p305_101|The party lasted all night.
p305_102|No details of the talks were given.
p305_103|It is understood they saw one body.
p305_104|It was a wilful act of violence.
p305_105|T, Is there anything in the wound?
p305_106|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p305_107|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p305_108|She is a double victim.
p305_109|They make a selective perception process.
p305_110|Everything on our programme is brilliant and diverse.
p305_111|It's the way we go about it.
p305_112|There was an e-mail.
p305_113|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p305_114|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p305_115|Each day is a new beginning.
p305_116|My daughter is an adult.
p305_117|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p305_118|We've come from a long way back.
p305_119|A lot of things can go wrong.
p305_120|He seemed to lose his focus.
p305_121|It is a vicious circle.
p305_122|She was eight months pregnant at the time.
p305_123|There has been no delay on government orders.
p305_124|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p305_125|Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
p305_126|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p305_127|How do you respond to losing your child?
p305_128|Who is the employer?
p305_129|This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?
p305_130|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
p305_131|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
p305_132|Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
p305_133|You can never have enough money.
p305_134|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
p305_135|I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
p305_136|Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
p305_137|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p305_138|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p305_139|They do the work, you know.
p305_140|Thus far we have received no complaints.
p305_141|I haven't made the donation yet.
p305_142|Other people also tried.
p305_143|Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
p305_144|It would have very little impact on them.
p305_145|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p305_146|My future is in the marathon.
p305_147|They were even being used by primary pupils.
p305_148|This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
p305_149|They chose to side with terror.
p305_150|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p305_151|They just made me feel dizzy.
p305_152|He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
p305_153|He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
p305_154|Health care workers and labourers followed.
p305_155|Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
p305_156|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p305_157|We have all been shocked by her death.
p305_158|We are asking the council to think again.
p305_159|He had worked there for only two days.
p305_160|Hopefully, now we're getting it.
p305_161|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
p305_162|For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
p305_163|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p305_164|Scotland need to work on two key areas.
p305_165|We have already begun to do that here.
p305_166|The home team also had their moments.
p305_167|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
p305_168|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
p305_169|That is where the club has gone wrong.
p305_170|I got off to a great start.
p305_171|It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
p305_172|The actor has met with Mandela.
p305_173|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p305_174|We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.
p305_175|I got on very well with Allan.
p305_176|That has given me great confidence.
p305_177|This is a dream come true for me.
p305_178|He was lying face down in the water.
p305_179|He urged people to forgive.
p305_180|So he is open to ideas.
p305_181|Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
p305_182|Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
p305_183|We are expected to do better than before.
p305_184|The attacker died in the crash.
p305_185|I am not even thinking about that.
p305_186|Angola was a really hard place.
p305_187|It is giving out the wrong message.
p305_188|It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
p305_189|The sleeper was six hours late.
p305_190|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p305_191|We want to keep the pound.
p305_192|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p305_193|He needed seven hours of surgery.
p305_194|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
p305_195|It just came into my head that day.
p305_196|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p305_197|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
p305_198|I am saddened to hear of the accident.
p305_199|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p305_200|He would help me with the form.
p305_201|The actors just have to say so.
p305_202|The minister is the engineer.
p305_203|I think it was briefly considered.
p305_204|It's a hidden problem.
p305_205|I lost a part of me.
p305_206|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p305_207|It's part of the game, isn't it?
p305_208|I believe in the Church.
p305_209|Others were even less confident.
p305_210|It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
p305_211|So people will come out with these things.
p305_212|You may have a short memory.
p305_213|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
p305_214|The whole thing is utterly transparent.
p305_215|Every game against New Zealand is.
p305_216|That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
p305_217|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
p305_218|It shows that painting is still relevant.
p305_219|Then there's one where people play for fun.
p305_220|It may be his last for a while, too.
p305_221|They have enough intrusion at the time.
p305_222|Then one night only three people turn up.
p305_223|The parents will have a great time, too.
p305_224|Now we see the impact of global politics.
p305_225|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
p305_226|Appointments should be made on merit.
p305_227|There have been a lot of lessons learned.
p305_228|I think we will join the single currency.
p305_229|Gilbert was not amused.
p305_230|Everything was up for grabs.
p305_231|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
p305_232|There will not be any charges.
p305_233|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p305_234|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p305_235|I think we have a very strong case.
p305_236|It should be a great game, though.
p305_237|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p305_238|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p305_239|So the process was refined.
p305_240|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p305_241|I have been here for only three months.
p305_242|They were not doing it too well, either.
p305_243|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p305_244|We hope this scheme will change that.
p305_245|How could anyone take issue with that?
p305_246|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p305_247|They were at her bedside when she died.
p305_248|They had had time for little else.
p305_249|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p305_250|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p305_251|She did not attend the courtroom.
p305_252|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
p305_253|The composer therefore believes he can do it.
p305_254|I still feel like a wee boy.
p305_255|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p305_256|But there was a shift.
p305_257|Israel has done very little until now.
p305_258|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p305_259|The death rates are still as high.
p305_260|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p305_261|We certainly will need to watch him.
p305_262|I don't think it could be clearer.
p305_263|We can only go up.
p305_264|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p305_265|Our offer will remain on the table.
p305_266|He is a man who lives to work.
p305_267|The website is now being amended.
p305_268|It's an internal matter.
p305_269|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
p305_270|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p305_271|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
p305_272|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p305_273|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p305_274|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p305_275|I am now just a bit uneasy.
p305_276|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p305_277|They married in August last year.
p305_278|Yet he chose to do something different.
p305_279|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
p305_280|The case will now go to appeal.
p305_281|They really did a great job.
p305_282|Our nation has been changed by this event.
p305_283|It was worth a photograph.
p305_284|I love you so very much.
p305_285|The road was closed for several hours.
p305_286|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p305_287|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p305_288|My aim is a top six finish.
p305_289|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p305_290|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p305_291|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p305_292|Most of the public are behind me.
p305_293|It really is a gift to the world.
p305_294|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p305_295|My house was shaking at the time.
p305_296|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p305_297|This is a very positive step forward.
p305_298|This is a huge confidence boost.
p305_299|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p305_300|Nobody even knew it had happened.
p305_301|She is a very lucky lady.
p305_302|We've been there for seven years.
p305_303|They made a huge impression on me.
p305_304|His signature is his handwriting.
p305_305|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p305_306|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p305_307|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p305_308|It worked, up to a point.
p305_309|One season, they might do well.
p305_310|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
p305_311|We've got a great defensive club.
p305_312|It's up to their parents to choose.
p305_313|I feel privileged to be here.
p305_314|She told me to apply for the crest.
p305_315|I think the Government should pay for that.
p305_316|It is still holding good today.
p305_317|The budget was too low for that.
p305_318|His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.
p305_319|The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
p305_320|We cannot rely on protracted legal proceedings.
p305_321|I know the worry over Iraq.
p305_322|I just could not cope.
p305_323|We didn't know he was even out.
p305_324|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p305_325|Here are some possible solutions.
p305_326|He made so many bad decisions.
p305_327|We are now up against it.
p305_328|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
p305_329|I would have dropped out otherwise.
p305_330|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
p305_331|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p305_332|I think he has undergone a sea change.
p305_333|One must hope not!
p305_334|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p305_335|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
p305_336|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
p305_337|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p305_338|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p305_339|This time, there were no such rewards.
p305_340|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p305_341|I'm just doing artwork.
p305_342|And we still have to pay his salary.
p305_343|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p305_344|So there's a double whammy.
p305_345|I didn't have a trio.
p305_346|Their three other children had died as infants.
p305_347|We knew nothing about it.
p305_348|I am astonished by this decision.
p305_349|I hope my successor will do the same.
p305_350|We have got a full house tonight.
p305_351|Our children are our future.
p305_352|We will see how he is.
p305_353|The fans will support us.
p305_354|It was a long process, but we got there.
p305_355|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p305_356|The whole team was rubbish.
p305_357|Now we need to keep our heads up.
p305_358|I put the drawing down.
p305_359|They feel it belongs to them.
p305_360|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p305_361|They too refused to come out and talk.
p305_362|It gave me something to focus on.
p305_363|It's the curse of our time, irony.
p305_364|It's a source of deep concern.
p305_365|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p305_366|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
p305_367|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p305_368|The Dow Jones is way up.
p305_369|Now there is an even bigger target.
p305_370|There has been a big change in defence.
p305_371|The Treasury confirmed that the latter was correct.
p305_372|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p305_373|The company has other problems with the shells.
p305_374|This must have been severe.
p305_375|We're all in a state of shock.
p305_376|I thought he was part of the camera.
p305_377|Farmers have been an endangered species.
p305_378|Injury has played a part, but not a big one.
p305_379|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
p305_380|He was released in March this year.
p305_381|The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
p305_382|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p305_383|We're not an employment agency.
p305_384|People might not actually want the job.
p305_385|The court had a number of empty seats.
p305_386|It is the logical extension of audio description.
p305_387|It broke up my marriage.
p305_388|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
p305_389|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
p305_390|The package has been properly costed.
p305_391|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p305_392|The love affair was over.
p305_393|For some, it was more painful than others.
p305_394|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
p305_395|I can't stop people thinking.
p305_396|The workers said they were treated like animals.
p305_397|She had every right to read the warrant.
p305_398|Several people were out in the street.
p305_399|There is too much at stake for that.
p305_400|A review group will report on Tuesday.
p305_401|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
p305_402|The place became a war zone.
p305_403|It is not an abortion.
p306_001|Please call Stella.
p306_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p306_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p306_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p306_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p306_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p306_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p306_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its paths high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p306_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p306_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p306_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p306_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p306_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p306_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p306_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p306_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p306_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p306_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p306_019|Since then physicists have found that is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p306_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p306_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p306_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p306_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p306_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p306_025|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p306_026|This is not a floating Las Vegas.
p306_027|This is not an amnesty.
p306_028|The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.
p306_029|Of course, this is nice to hear.
p306_030|It was between myself, the management, and the team.
p306_031|I don't believe you own anything.
p306_032|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
p306_033|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p306_034|Blood samples have been taken.
p306_035|Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
p306_036|He said he now intends to fly today.
p306_037|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p306_038|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p306_039|A further police inquiry is currently being held.
p306_040|Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
p306_041|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p306_042|A recording contract is on the horizon.
p306_043|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p306_044|We like being the underdogs.
p306_045|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
p306_046|We will continue to operate within the sport.
p306_047|But the law is very clear on this.
p306_048|But all forms of the illness are treatable.
p306_049|It is also central to the unfolding drama.
p306_050|Except for this, it was offside.
p306_051|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
p306_052|It's a grey area.
p306_053|Retirement, who knows?
p306_054|He was shocked by what he saw.
p306_055|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p306_056|It comes on like a tidal wave.
p306_057|England and Wales are likely to pull out.
p306_058|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally replaced.
p306_059|He was taken ill in December last year.
p306_060|We welcome the decisions of Mr Byers.
p306_061|It's all too short term.
p306_062|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
p306_063|Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
p306_064|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p306_065|His rival's are spoken with elan.
p306_066|He also does not get on with Christina.
p306_067|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
p306_068|How things have changed since then.
p306_069|Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
p306_070|This is the way things should be handled.
p306_071|For me, the tour is wide open this year.
p306_072|In the past few years, they have started to fight back.
p306_073|The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
p306_074|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
p306_075|She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.
p306_076|Henman is taking nothing for granted.
p306_077|You'd think there was a match on today.
p306_078|We must move on.
p306_079|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p306_080|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
p306_081|His options are severely limited.
p306_082|It is truly fields of miracles.
p306_083|They are not an item.
p306_084|Why did they let him go?
p306_085|Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.
p306_086|I have made good progress.
p306_087|We do need a new one.
p306_088|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p306_089|We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
p306_090|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p306_091|He then had a swipe at Hearts.
p306_092|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p306_093|But the relief was short-lived.
p306_094|You had better believe it.
p306_095|The mood is upbeat.
p306_096|They told us about it the next day.
p306_097|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p306_098|There are a huge number of arts.
p306_099|They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.

p306_102|Where is the anthrax?
p306_103|Housing is in very short supply.
p306_104|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
p306_105|People just came on their own.
p306_106|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
p306_107|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
p306_108|You either have him or you don't.
p306_109|There are some new buildings in there.
p306_110|I am prepared to step down.
p306_111|I'm not a diva.
p306_112|There is great relief at this point.
p306_113|Look at them after three days of rain.
p306_114|I didn't realise it had reached that stage.
p306_115|There is no point in pushing it.
p306_116|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p306_117|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p306_118|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
p306_119|Completion is expected by October the following year.
p306_120|However, it very nearly all went wrong.
p306_121|It is not a definite proposal as yet.
p306_122|I will speak to Michael about this.
p306_123|This is not understood by people outside.
p306_124|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
p306_125|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p306_126|There is a lack of chemistry.
p306_127|I went straight to the toilet.
p306_128|She says the royal family get on well.
p306_129|Does a firefighter have to be killed?
p306_130|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
p306_131|That group reported just before Christmas.
p306_132|I've always been desperate to play this part.
p306_133|We haven't actually considered it down here.
p306_134|There is still much work to be done.
p306_135|However, details have yet to be worked out.
p306_136|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
p306_137|One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
p306_138|We were with him the whole time.
p306_139|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
p306_140|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
p306_141|That's because we work hard at it.
p306_142|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p306_143|He's been the key to everything.
p306_144|Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
p306_145|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p306_146|They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
p306_147|We need a new kind of theatre.
p306_148|I was in the train station overnight.
p306_149|I feel my life to be at risk.
p306_150|Again and again, at every level, he delivered the goods.
p306_151|That would be poetic, wouldn't it?
p306_152|We came across the first set of bodies.
p306_153|We need some confidence to get a win.
p306_154|Does that put pressure on us?
p306_155|You've seen the polls then, Sean.
p306_156|This is a foolish idea.
p306_157|You might even have seen him.
p306_158|Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
p306_159|They thought they had found a home.
p306_160|She collapsed and died a day later.
p306_161|You should be there with six different characters.
p306_162|Laura is an investment banker.
p306_163|I took a minibus into town.
p306_164|I do my job.

p306_166|Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
p306_167|Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
p306_168|Four policemen were wounded.
p306_169|Who do these people think they are?
p306_171|We want to help them through it.
p306_172|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
p306_173|It has been recorded twice.
p306_174|It was a bit like having children.
p306_175|You cannot eat in the dining room.
p306_176|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p306_177|It shows that we are a civilised society.
p306_178|It's a commission, and for it's work, a year's work.
p306_179|I came home by ambulance.
p306_180|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p306_181|It was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
p306_182|She is living proof of their expertise.
p306_183|This one was my best chance.
p306_184|We believe a third party was involved.
p306_185|I am writing a novel.
p306_186|A bit of match fitness is required.
p306_187|All were paid by the taxpayer.
p306_188|The faith of large numbers remain unknown.
p306_189|It was located on the remote control.
p306_190|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
p306_191|Twaddle is a case in point.
p306_192|These elements are in the book.
p306_193|You look at them and you understand.
p306_194|I am considered a teenager.
p306_195|I would like Glasgow.
p306_196|The FBI could become involved.
p306_197|We have only nine months to go.
p306_198|Both of them have looked good.
p306_199|I like footballers who play well.
p306_201|The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
p306_202|Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
p306_203|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
p306_204|Donald was a man with many friends.
p306_205|We played them off the pitch.
p306_206|It was turning that way all across Europe.
p306_207|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p306_208|We were on top and could have won.
p306_209|That night was a terrible muddle.
p306_210|The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
p306_211|He ended up a headmaster.
p306_212|He was too good for me - too consistent.
p306_213|It is like being a qualifier again.
p306_214|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p306_215|If we live forever, can we be said to live?
p306_216|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
p306_217|I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
p306_218|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
p306_219|I might get an injury very easily.
p306_220|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p306_221|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p306_222|It was a stunning drive from Jon.
p306_223|She didn't tell us anything new.
p306_224|There is nothing like this back home.
p306_225|And that gives a kind of freedom.
p306_226|I found a fault and worked at it.
p306_227|It was a poor performance.
p306_228|They may yet have the last laugh.
p306_229|You can feel at home in China.
p306_230|This is all part of being opening the door.
p306_231|We have tried to keep his head up.
p306_232|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
p306_233|He will become the sovereign.
p306_234|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p306_235|Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
p306_236|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
p306_237|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p306_238|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p306_239|It's just gotten too big.
p306_240|Was all this really just five months ago?
p306_241|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p306_242|They were two different types.
p306_243|It need not be like that.
p306_244|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
p306_245|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p306_246|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p306_247|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
p306_248|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p306_249|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p306_250|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p306_251|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p306_252|I just saw them for a few minutes.
p306_253|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
p306_254|People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
p306_255|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p306_256|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p306_257|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
p306_258|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
p306_259|It's the stop-gap before extinction.
p306_260|He must have something up his sleeve.
p306_261|If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
p306_262|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
p306_263|That means no more taxation by stealth.
p306_264|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
p306_265|Holland won by five wickets.
p306_266|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
p306_267|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
p306_268|Once they go away they won't come back.
p306_269|THE best marriages are made in heaven.
p306_270|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
p306_272|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p306_273|The board has rejected her proposals.
p306_274|It does not move, which is amazing.
p306_275|She is a very lucky young lady.
p306_276|The threat to rural areas is real.
p306_277|Tourism continues to struggle.
p306_278|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
p306_279|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
p306_281|This is a great shame.
p306_282|That was merely their initial problem.
p306_283|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
p306_284|We said, What do you mean?
p306_285|I need them to set my career.
p306_286|The law will take its course.
p306_287|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
p306_288|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
p306_289|The fund has three elements.
p306_290|This is a young team, you know.
p306_291|It's not even finished.
p306_292|Everyone knew where they were.
p306_293|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminister Hall.
p306_294|In the old days, it was easy.
p306_295|People will make up their own minds.
p306_296|After that he became more romantic.
p306_297|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p306_298|My view has now completely changed.
p306_299|They finished second and third.
p306_300|We agreed to disagree.
p306_301|He was then replaced by Ross.
p306_302|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
p306_303|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p306_304|We've always had three options, and none of them perfect.
p306_305|People can get them if they want.
p306_306|Their message was simple.
p306_307|They're currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p306_308|He is a law unto himself.
p306_309|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p306_310|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
p306_311|An aide was instructed to get a copy.
p306_312|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p306_313|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
p306_314|It was just completely erased.
p306_315|A great deal has been achieved.
p306_316|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p306_317|I enjoy playing with both of them.
p306_318|Too often it is not.
p306_319|I tend to not look back.
p306_320|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p306_321|I got a yellow card.
p306_322|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
p306_323|I didn't know what he was capable of.
p306_324|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
p306_325|It's good to start with Judith.
p306_326|She is now on the back benches.
p306_327|It may also be her last.
p306_328|Maybe it helps us.
p306_329|Three bystanders were killed.
p306_330|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p306_331|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p306_332|He made no big mistakes.
p306_333|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p306_334|We will be homeless.
p306_335|I believe he can do a better job.
p306_336|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p306_337|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p306_338|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p307_001|Please call Stella.
p307_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p307_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p307_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p307_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p307_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p307_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p307_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p307_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p307_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p307_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p307_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p307_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p307_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p307_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p307_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p307_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p307_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p307_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p307_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p307_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p307_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p307_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p307_025|But it was a great decision he joked.
p307_026|They changed the world of music.
p307_027|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p307_028|The law has got to be upheld.
p307_029|But we're not the same person.
p307_030|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
p307_031|I saw the explosion and panicked.
p307_032|The punishment was swift.
p307_033|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p307_034|I kept my side of the bargain.
p307_035|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p307_036|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p307_037|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p307_038|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p307_039|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p307_040|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p307_041|It doesn't make them evil.
p307_042|I have played really well all year.
p307_043|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
p307_044|Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
p307_045|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
p307_046|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p307_047|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p307_048|I try not to expect anything.
p307_049|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p307_050|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p307_051|It was, however, the wrong side.
p307_052|She is now planning a visit.
p307_053|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p307_054|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p307_055|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p307_056|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p307_057|I keep my fingers crossed.
p307_058|The encounter was to change his life.
p307_059|It's the best of both worlds.
p307_060|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p307_061|That is why we want this decision reversed.
p307_062|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p307_063|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
p307_064|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
p307_065|After this, the exercise was due to begin.
p307_066|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
p307_067|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p307_068|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
p307_069|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p307_070|When he took over it really took off.
p307_071|That's just the way the game is evolving.
p307_072|Michael is putting on a brave face.
p307_073|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p307_074|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
p307_075|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p307_076|This is a mental challenge.
p307_077|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p307_078|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
p307_079|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p307_080|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p307_081|He came in an army uniform.
p307_082|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
p307_083|Cars are great for going long distances.
p307_084|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p307_085|I knew he would play two weeks ago.
p307_086|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
p307_087|It has never been worthwhile.
p307_088|So other options had to be explored.
p307_089|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p307_090|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
p307_091|People love to see this stuff.
p307_092|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
p307_093|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p307_094|His female companion was being treated for shock.
p307_095|I have no plans to change the oath.
p307_096|We did not even get a free kick.
p307_097|He was married with a young child.
p307_098|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p307_099|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
p307_100|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p307_101|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p307_102|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p307_103|I am very sorry to be here.
p307_104|I needed a change, a new challenge.
p307_105|Is your life a little too easy?
p307_106|I think my game is suited to grass.
p307_107|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
p307_108|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
p307_109|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p307_110|People want to see me on the screen.
p307_111|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p307_112|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p307_113|The conversion didn't go over either.
p307_114|He took away my childhood.
p307_115|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p307_116|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p307_117|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p307_118|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p307_119|It is not great art.
p307_120|You do not change overnight.
p307_121|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p307_122|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p307_123|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p307_124|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p307_125|We aim to put them out of business.
p307_126|Tony Blair should get out more.
p307_127|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p307_128|He was just awesome.
p307_129|We now have to concentrate on the league.
p307_130|We need to move forward together.
p307_131|She died in hospital two hours later.
p307_132|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
p307_133|Both were later released after a check-up.
p307_134|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
p307_135|How good is Lennox Lewis?
p307_136|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p307_137|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p307_138|The son has autism and other problems.
p307_139|I'm very puzzled by it.
p307_140|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p307_141|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
p307_142|We are both very confused and extremely angry.
p307_143|All things are possible if you believe.
p307_144|This was not just incongruous.
p307_145|It is patently true.
p307_146|You hope he prevails.
p307_147|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p307_148|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
p307_149|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
p307_150|But it looks good for next year.
p307_151|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
p307_152|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p307_153|He was forced to quit.
p307_154|It is good for their eyesight.
p307_155|I was loving that little girl.
p307_156|But you can't have it both ways.
p307_157|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
p307_158|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p307_159|The death toll included five children.
p307_160|Before the game we went for a pint.
p307_161|There is no credible official announcement.
p307_162|I understand the medical concerns.
p307_163|This is a United Kingdom.
p307_164|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p307_165|I'm aware that somebody made a threat.
p307_166|However, who could have predicted this result?
p307_167|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p307_168|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p307_169|They were behind the wheel.
p307_170|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p307_171|The problem arises because he does so much.
p307_172|The answer is mayhem.
p307_173|Our young people are leaving.
p307_174|What, then, is the real thing?
p307_175|I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
p307_176|That will be the sweetness.
p307_177|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
p307_178|The big issue for us is the review.
p307_179|There was a fossil on screen.
p307_180|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
p307_181|This does not create any precedent.
p307_182|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
p307_183|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p307_184|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p307_185|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p307_186|The early evidence suggests he did not.
p307_187|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p307_188|I hope you miss the cut.
p307_189|The role was perfect for Russell.
p307_190|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
p307_191|We are seeking funds from government departments.
p307_192|That, though, was again according to the manager McCall.
p307_193|He scored one goal and was on fire.
p307_194|I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
p307_195|Harold is a rarity.
p307_196|Walk out the door and anything can happen.
p307_197|I want him to take on Gomez.
p307_198|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p307_199|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p307_200|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p307_201|Well, what do you know?
p307_202|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p307_203|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p307_204|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p307_205|He will emerge as a world leader.
p307_206|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p307_207|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p307_208|We have no choice but to shut down.
p307_209|The prognosis is excellent.
p307_210|They always want to give a performance.
p307_211|But he just carried on anyway.
p307_212|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p307_213|I would not want to be young again.
p307_214|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p307_215|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p307_216|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p307_217|They were later discharged from hospital.
p307_218|These findings would be made public.
p307_219|What are you not good at?
p307_220|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p307_221|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
p307_222|This makes no sense!
p307_223|I go home only once.
p307_224|It had a gigantic effect.
p307_225|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p307_226|If not, a deal could take many months.
p307_227|The team this year is going places.
p307_228|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
p307_229|It took more than two years.
p307_230|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
p307_231|He said because people had invited him.
p307_232|That's the key issue isn't it?
p307_233|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
p307_234|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p307_235|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p307_236|I came up through the ranks.
p307_237|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p307_238|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p307_239|These guys will not lie down.
p307_240|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p307_241|That is nearly four people every day.
p307_242|There are nine people here now.
p307_243|His son is a local legend.
p307_244|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p307_245|Which perhaps is just as well.
p307_246|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p307_247|He would just say it was terrible.
p307_248|This is the New Edinburgh.
p307_249|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p307_250|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
p307_251|We kept going right to the final whistle.
p307_252|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p307_253|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p307_254|The final stage is paranoia.
p307_255|I am not holding the club to ransom.
p307_256|Wanger was never like this.
p307_257|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p307_258|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p307_259|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
p307_260|That's the sort of game you want.
p307_261|We're not travel agents.
p307_262|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p307_263|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p307_264|It's the same old story.
p307_265|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p307_266|It was a moment of madness.
p307_267|I do not own the vessel in question.
p307_268|Racism has no place in any sport.
p307_269|I am not happy with proposals for widows.
p307_270|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
p307_271|Bombing is the easy option.
p307_272|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p307_273|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p307_274|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p307_275|I'd say we should give it a week.
p307_276|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p307_277|Little Voice is on general release.
p307_278|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p307_279|There is no substitute.
p307_280|That nation is South Africa.
p307_281|This will secure the future of our industry.
p307_282|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p307_283|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p307_284|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p307_285|It was an empowering journey.
p307_286|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p307_287|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
p307_288|They had been together for about three years.
p307_289|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
p307_290|Everything has been destroyed.
p307_291|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
p307_292|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
p307_293|We just want to get stuck in now.
p307_294|Do you come from Moscow?
p307_295|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p307_296|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p307_297|They are the innocent victims.
p307_298|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p307_299|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p307_300|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p307_301|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p307_302|Broke the birdie record.
p307_303|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p307_304|They tried to give her advice.
p307_305|That it is a brand name.
p307_306|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p307_307|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p307_308|They will have to make changes.
p307_309|This fact is supported by audience research.
p307_310|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p307_311|Both sides have to step back.
p307_312|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p307_313|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p307_314|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
p307_315|We are ready for the long haul.
p307_316|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p307_317|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p307_318|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p307_319|EMI is a prime example.
p307_320|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p307_321|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p307_322|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p307_323|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p307_324|A friendship that will endure.
p307_325|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p307_326|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p307_327|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p307_328|He is young but not too young.
p307_329|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p307_330|It will also take evidence from consumers.
p307_331|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p307_332|I am not obsessed with sex.
p307_333|They've been at it for five hours.
p307_334|There is no answer to it.
p307_335|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p307_336|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p307_337|His English counterpart agreed.
p307_338|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p307_339|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p307_340|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
p307_341|I am not putting myself down.
p307_342|He's a joy to follow.
p307_343|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p307_344|We were lucky to have survived.
p307_345|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p307_346|At this level, you have all to perform well.
p307_347|I just want to change my life.
p307_348|He did not oppose the divorce.
p307_349|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p307_350|And Michael was just great.
p307_351|He knew it would cost him millions.
p307_352|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p307_353|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p307_354|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
p307_355|That only came out during a radio interview.
p307_356|We are now setting about finding them.
p307_357|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p307_358|We must not go down that road.
p307_359|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p307_360|I am not among its admirers.
p307_361|And that match was played in June.
p307_362|He will address the nation this evening.
p307_363|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p307_364|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p307_365|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p307_366|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p307_367|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p307_368|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p307_369|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p307_370|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p307_371|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p307_372|His job was not advertised.
p307_373|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p307_374|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p307_375|He has changed my life for ever.
p307_376|The home was now under new management.
p307_377|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p307_378|There is no openness.
p307_379|It's being very carefully looked at.
p307_380|It was a job he loved.
p307_381|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p307_382|Filtering through this material a composite finale emerges.
p307_383|Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
p307_384|It looks like paradise.
p307_386|We were short of athletes.
p307_387|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p307_388|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p307_389|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p307_390|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p307_391|I had no qualms about it.
p307_392|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p307_393|McMaster had already seen the first part.
p307_394|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p307_395|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
p307_396|It was early morning.
p307_397|Partition is not an option.
p307_398|What other retailer would do this?
p307_399|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p307_400|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p307_401|I won't go back to Holland.
p307_402|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p308_001|Please call Stella.
p308_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p308_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p308_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p308_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p308_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p308_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p308_008|They take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p308_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p308_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p308_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p308_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p308_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p308_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p308_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p308_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p308_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p308_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p308_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p308_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p308_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p308_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition on a number of bows.
p308_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p308_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p308_025|It does make a big difference.
p308_026|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p308_027|Each one has its own system.
p308_028|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p308_029|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p308_030|It is a very special city.
p308_031|It has been blown out of all proportion.
p308_032|He is not very big, either.
p308_033|I've taken to the hills.
p308_034|My game is in pretty good shape.
p308_035|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p308_036|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p308_037|We used to keep our business rates.
p308_038|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p308_039|All of us do.
p308_040|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p308_041|It could have been just a quick fix.
p308_042|We are looking for volunteers.
p308_043|Theatre is not a museum.
p308_044|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p308_045|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p308_046|He could face a jail sentence.
p308_047|They don't take you to mass graves.
p308_048|What's it got to do with art?
p308_049|Happily we found it in the library.
p308_050|I know a lot of people who don't.
p308_051|There was nobody on the roof.
p308_052|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p308_053|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p308_054|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p308_055|The days of empty promises are over.
p308_056|Henry was strong and talented.
p308_057|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p308_058|We must improve our relations with government.
p308_059|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p308_060|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p308_061|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p308_062|He said it was the worst possible result.
p308_063|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p308_064|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p308_065|It is just part of modern day life.
p308_066|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p308_067|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p308_068|YOU thought it was a headache.
p308_069|I hope we can put it behind us.
p308_070|But it was to no avail.
p308_071|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p308_072|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p308_073|That alibi is now gone.
p308_074|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p308_075|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p308_076|You do have a way out.
p308_077|It is simple, really.
p308_078|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p308_079|I was in jail for five years.
p308_080|You, the British people, are the boss.
p308_081|A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
p308_082|PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
p308_083|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p308_084|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p308_085|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p308_086|She could easily have been killed.
p308_087|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p308_088|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p308_089|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p308_090|The same goes for personnel.
p308_091|He was a crazy man.
p308_092|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
p308_093|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p308_094|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p308_095|There was an element of jealousy.
p308_096|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p308_097|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p308_098|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p308_099|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p308_100|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p308_101|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p308_102|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
p308_103|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p308_104|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p308_105|It separates the men from the boys.
p308_106|But that attachment took a lot of growing.
p308_107|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p308_108|Two and a half million people have died.
p308_109|Or so it would appear.
p308_110|I hope they understand that.
p308_111|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p308_112|She will also get a pay rise.
p308_113|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p308_114|It is time for a more honest approach.
p308_115|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p308_116|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p308_117|I want to play at the highest level.
p308_118|Stalkers are capable of killing.
p308_119|It ignores the future.
p308_120|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p308_121|The trial is set for February.
p308_122|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p308_123|Do not go into government buildings.
p308_124|There is only one caveat.
p308_125|We are still getting signals.
p308_126|And perhaps it is as simple as that.
p308_127|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p308_128|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p308_129|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p308_130|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p308_131|I heard some of his remarks.
p308_132|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p308_133|I was just overwhelmed.
p308_134|It had been in place since last July.
p308_135|The European Court is our only option.
p308_136|Do you think they would do any better?
p308_137|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p308_138|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p308_139|The singer's condition was not specified.
p308_140|How much of a cop out is that?
p308_141|The whole region is in shock.
p308_142|It will be the final push.
p308_143|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p308_144|You were the kidnappers.
p308_145|It is a very interesting subject.
p308_146|The women were on their way home yesterday.
p308_147|I could feel the blood on my face.
p308_148|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p308_149|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p308_150|Debbie Harry was cool.
p308_151|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p308_152|That sort of thing is long gone.
p308_153|I'm afraid to say anything.
p308_154|I know you went back this morning.
p308_155|We did not want an absentee landlord.
p308_156|These men could be anywhere in the world.
p308_157|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
p308_158|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p308_159|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p308_160|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p308_161|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p308_162|The red card was okay.
p308_163|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p308_164|But they will not be compelled to join.
p308_165|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p308_166|I was doing well at the hustings.
p308_167|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p308_168|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p308_169|We must put a marker down.
p308_170|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p308_171|There is no date on this document.
p308_172|And now he tells us.
p308_173|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p308_174|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p308_175|It is time to come into the limelight.
p308_176|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p308_177|His name is Michael Owen.
p308_178|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p308_179|I will have to order its destruction.
p308_180|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p308_181|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p308_182|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p308_183|Smith has not let him down.
p308_184|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p308_185|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
p308_186|They've two children.
p308_187|Luckily, our patient was stable.
p308_188|I'm really proud of my young players.
p308_189|People buy everything with cash.
p308_190|There was great support all round the route.
p308_191|It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
p308_192|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p308_193|Scottish fishermen condemned the decision.
p308_194|Or so we have long assumed.
p308_195|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p308_196|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p308_197|It's not just for classical music.
p308_198|This must be kept in total perspective.
p308_199|All of the names are familiar to me.
p308_200|They had not been handcuffed.
p308_201|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p308_202|I've never been limited on drugs.
p308_203|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p308_204|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p308_205|We have chosen for the patients.
p308_206|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p308_207|Why should we even be asked to share?
p308_208|Which means it matters.
p308_209|There is great potential on this river.
p308_210|I was surprised by his response.
p308_211|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p308_212|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p308_213|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p308_214|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p308_215|Is this accurate?
p308_216|A judicial review is also being considered.
p308_217|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p308_218|They could go no further forward.
p308_219|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p308_220|Appointed general secretary last September.
p308_221|They make it look very easy.
p308_222|It was a total surprise.
p308_223|I had enough on.
p308_224|And we're not there yet.
p308_225|No meaningful response was issued.
p308_226|It is a form of physical exercise.
p308_227|plays in dark blue.
p308_228|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
p308_229|It is something that we will put right.
p308_230|Survival is our aim.
p308_231|There is no reason at all.
p308_232|This is her first senior Scottish selection.
p308_233|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p308_234|I'm pleased with the horse.
p308_235|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
p308_236|There is a club on the rise.
p308_237|I had a sense of deja vu.
p308_238|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p308_239|They follow him everywhere.
p308_240|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p308_241|There was no safety net.
p308_242|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
p308_243|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
p308_244|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
p308_245|Mr Miller is married with three children.
p308_246|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p308_247|We have great sympathy with Danny.
p308_248|He should be a great asset.
p308_249|It means they actually control the programme.
p308_250|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p308_251|We are not out of touch with politics.
p308_252|We could have got three medals.
p308_253|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p308_254|We are at a crossroads.
p308_255|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p308_256|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p308_257|It didn't take long.
p308_258|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p308_259|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p308_260|I started on fire a couple of times.
p308_261|He also received a medal of honour.
p308_262|It's not one for the purists.
p308_263|She said he showed no remorse.
p308_264|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p308_265|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p308_266|It is a time bomb.
p308_267|It's a matter of huge concern.
p308_268|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p308_269|Three years probation is just a joke.
p308_270|The outstanding issues are still there.
p308_271|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p308_272|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
p308_273|And that's good news for the magpies.
p308_274|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
p308_275|That got me out of jail.
p308_276|We've turned the corner.
p308_277|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
p308_278|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p308_279|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p308_280|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p308_281|We've taken steps to rectify it.
p308_282|I see no need for change.
p308_283|Do yourselves a favour.
p308_284|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p308_285|Others said they had been beaten by police.
p308_286|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p308_287|I'd love to be like Peter.
p308_288|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p308_289|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p308_290|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p308_291|His is a success story by any standard.
p308_292|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p308_293|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p308_294|Is something which we just don't do.
p308_295|We work on the same level.
p308_296|I've got a young family.
p308_297|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p308_298|It all seemed so easy.
p308_299|I really don't understand what is happening.
p308_300|The frustration was showing.
p308_301|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p308_302|I am a wealthy person.
p308_303|My friends were very envious.
p308_304|The snipers are also out.
p308_305|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p308_306|We're determined to establish the facts.
p308_307|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p308_308|The list is too long for this piece.
p308_309|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p308_310|Entries for the event are still being accepted.
p308_311|It plans to return to this field.
p308_312|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p308_313|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p308_314|Tonight's matches European Championship.
p308_315|It's like the Russians.
p308_316|Is that Titanic?
p308_317|Let us hope so.
p308_318|So, the question is, is it any good?
p308_319|I'm getting back up there now.
p308_320|I couldn't see any reason not to die.
p308_321|My players have no idea about football.
p308_322|They are there to get people into work.
p308_323|I'm getting long in the tooth.
p308_324|They would be wise to do just that.
p308_325|Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
p308_326|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p308_327|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p308_328|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p308_329|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p308_330|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p308_331|I'd go to bookshops.
p308_332|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p308_333|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p308_334|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
p308_335|Military chiefs were playing it straight.
p308_336|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p308_337|There was no hint of bravado.
p308_338|You've been a great audience.
p308_339|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
p308_340|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p308_341|She's a valuable member of the Government.
p308_342|I just need a bit of luck.
p308_343|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p308_344|I always felt they played for me.
p308_345|Again, it's about responding to your resources.
p308_346|Managers and clinicians must work together.
p308_347|The princess has had other health problems.
p308_348|Everything else is a bonus.
p308_349|The hotel was now for sale.
p308_350|There are two games to go after that.
p308_351|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p308_352|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
p308_353|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
p308_354|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
p308_355|It was a UK-wide report.
p308_356|This is a dreadful day for Iona.
p308_357|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
p308_358|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p308_359|The discussions will surely not last too long.
p308_360|We'll talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p308_361|They have not let anyone into the loop.
p308_362|So just what is her enduring appeal?
p308_363|It's not easy to live in Russia.
p308_364|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p308_365|Last night was a key episode.
p308_366|I grew up listening to these people.
p308_367|It is normal for me.
p308_368|But it may not be all bad news.
p308_369|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p308_370|I am content with the silver.
p308_371|We have fun in our lives.
p308_372|This, too, could prove a risky business.
p308_373|You have to audition for jobs.
p308_374|We're not comparing like with like.
p308_375|Ferguson should take note.
p308_376|We have always been, and remain confident of securing the order.
p308_377|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p308_378|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p308_379|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p308_380|She was released from hospital yesterday.
p308_381|That is not just my personal view.
p308_382|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p308_383|It's like a garage.
p308_384|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p308_385|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p308_386|Liberal Democrat leader makes a hash of it.
p308_387|You just have to accept.
p308_388|We've got to get it right.
p308_389|The trouble is, though, that there is no simple solution.
p308_390|His death was a tragic accident.
p308_391|Would you take them?
p308_392|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p308_393|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
p308_394|His condition was stable last night.
p308_395|I'd never seen a play about me.
p308_396|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
p308_397|The report is due out next month.
p308_398|It was nerve-racking to watch.
p308_399|It remains in public ownership.
p308_400|The Master was by then just too old.
p308_401|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
p308_402|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p308_403|It's a very high number.
p310_001|Please call Stella.
p310_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p310_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p310_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p310_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p310_006|When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p310_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p310_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and these two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p310_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p310_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p310_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p310_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p310_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
p310_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p310_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p310_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to the home in the skies.
p310_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p310_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p310_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p310_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p310_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p310_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p310_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p310_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p310_025|He was the youngest of the British team.
p310_026|I fell in love with the ballet.
p310_027|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
p310_028|It feels like a winner already.
p310_029|Did you see that?
p310_030|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p310_031|And the winners are.
p310_032|I can't believe something like this could happen.
p310_033|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p310_034|He didn't really, we just made that up.
p310_035|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p310_036|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p310_037|It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
p310_038|We're still talking with a few people.
p310_039|But one shouldn't go by that.
p310_040|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p310_041|Buying our way out is not an option.
p310_042|There are big names.
p310_043|That argument has been won.
p310_044|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p310_045|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p310_046|And who would argue with that?
p310_047|I hope you will leave it at that.
p310_048|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p310_049|They had four children together.
p310_050|Again, that was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p310_051|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p310_052|I fell to the ground.
p310_053|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p310_054|They were not defeated.
p310_055|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
p310_056|How can they engage with the work?
p310_057|All of us know it exists.
p310_058|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
p310_059|This is the band.
p310_060|She has a wonderful mind.
p310_061|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p310_062|We're into that build-up now.
p310_063|It is the end of an era.
p310_064|We shall not do that.
p310_065|I have had no social life at all.
p310_066|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p310_067|Once again, he refused.
p310_068|This is about the Orange Order.
p310_069|In fact, they will not be disciplined.
p310_070|We're not the tourist board.
p310_071|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
p310_072|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
p310_073|The Commons is too outdated.
p310_074|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
p310_075|That was then and this is now.
p310_076|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p310_077|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p310_078|Are you watching Liverpool?
p310_079|He would be with his peers.
p310_080|They seem to be backing off from that.
p310_081|But it took a lot of bottle.
p310_082|They don't work anymore anyway.
p310_083|I wish they, too, would get a grip.
p310_084|I am so sorry.
p310_085|This avalanche is just beginning.
p310_086|Journalists should make him.
p310_087|I believe we have a good chance.
p310_088|However, it is no longer with the national team.
p310_089|She may even appear in some more films.
p310_090|This is the best moment of my career.
p310_091|He also called in at another farm.
p310_092|I don't know why she is not here.
p310_093|England could not take anything for granted, however.
p310_094|I agree with them.
p310_095|I feel very strongly about that.
p310_096|Now he will have to start again.
p310_097|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p310_098|I don't know how it happened.
p310_099|Peter doesn't want to leave.
p310_100|After that nothing could save him.
p310_101|Construction is due to begin in February.
p310_102|We shall rely on human beings.
p310_103|In fact, that would be a distortion of the truth.
p310_104|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p310_105|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p310_106|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p310_107|Or, rather, it isn't.
p310_108|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p310_109|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p310_110|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p310_111|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p310_112|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p310_113|But there is another side.
p310_114|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p310_115|There is no guarantee.
p310_116|I'm confident we can turn things around.
p310_117|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p310_118|It may be argued.
p310_119|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p310_120|I bought a car at auction.
p310_121|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p310_122|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
p310_123|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p310_124|Five in a month isn't good enough.
p310_125|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p310_126|This is just one example.
p310_127|Both offices were closed yesterday.
p310_128|They don't have to, but they normally do.
p310_129|We stopped at half-time.
p310_130|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p310_131|David was not either.
p310_132|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p310_133|We don't see it as downgrading.
p310_134|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p310_135|No date has been set for the appeal.
p310_136|He is dying from cancer.
p310_137|People can describe a moment in their life.
p310_138|What's the rush?
p310_139|The starting point is pretty unusual.
p310_140|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p310_141|They receive a high profile in the media.
p310_142|It was an ambush.
p310_143|I think this proposal is excellent.
p310_144|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p310_145|Is that too much to ask?
p310_146|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p310_147|I've so much respect for him.
p310_148|Each one has its own system.
p310_149|I felt under no pressure today.
p310_150|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p310_151|And that was the adults.
p310_152|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p310_153|This is a job for the Government.
p310_154|I felt the head was very like me.
p310_155|We started with that.
p310_156|And he had much need.
p310_157|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p310_158|This can only help us go forward.
p310_159|It's never the same problem.
p310_160|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p310_161|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
p310_162|I hadn't been looking after myself.
p310_163|I was over the moon.
p310_164|And really, the songs are the key thing.
p310_165|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p310_166|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p310_167|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
p310_168|And then came the seventies.
p310_169|I guess it is down to focus.
p310_170|Last week, he was taken to the hospital.
p310_171|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
p310_172|His track record is not promising.
p310_173|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p310_174|He put a lot of effort into it.
p310_175|However, you have just got to adjust it.
p310_176|That was moving the goalposts.
p310_177|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p310_178|We have the location, which is assured.
p310_179|The club are feeling no different today.
p310_180|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p310_181|I see the extended family once a year.
p310_182|I'm not a magician.
p310_183|We couldn't go very fast.
p310_185|There was even a joke.
p310_186|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p310_187|This guy is never going to give up.
p310_188|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p310_189|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p310_190|The show is small but perfectly formed.
p310_191|This is the first job of the director - leadership.
p310_192|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p310_193|It is too early to speculate.
p310_194|I just had so much fun.
p310_195|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p310_196|I will wait until later.
p310_197|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p310_198|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p310_199|Or so we have long assumed.
p310_200|They responded with victories.
p310_201|That was the personal impulse.
p310_202|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p310_203|But first it goes out on TV.
p310_204|What is the truth about the cow?
p310_205|They will want to watch a winning team.
p310_206|I think it's awful.
p310_207|Who is going to be penalised?
p310_208|This will be just another tax on motorists.
p310_209|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p310_210|One must hope not!
p310_211|He is a Satan.
p310_212|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p310_213|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p310_214|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p310_215|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p310_216|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
p310_217|There was no cohesion.
p310_218|He was jailed for five years.
p310_219|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p310_220|We will not break even.
p310_221|We will look into it.
p310_222|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p310_223|But he's not afraid to take risks.
p310_224|Some of his family still live there.
p310_225|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p310_226|However, it very nearly went wrong.
p310_227|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p310_228|Things are moving together.
p310_229|I get to work with very good people.
p310_230|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p310_231|He must not be removed from office.
p310_232|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p310_233|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p310_234|Look at the table.
p310_235|This film will be totally awesome.
p310_236|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p310_237|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p310_238|Last year was not a good year.
p310_239|It's a difficult job.
p310_240|We can't get over it.
p310_241|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p310_242|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p310_243|This represents a tough game for us.
p310_244|He saw it all as a big game.
p310_245|They are not an item.
p310_246|And thought we would get away with it.
p310_247|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p310_248|It's more like a Labour Party rally.
p310_249|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
p310_250|I would urge the Government to think again.
p310_251|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p310_252|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p310_253|I was happiest with my short game.
p310_254|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
p310_255|We went on to become very successful.
p310_256|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
p310_257|No, is the answer to your first question.
p310_258|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
p310_259|That could be at least five years away.
p310_260|That is my role.
p310_261|He also presented You Bet!
p310_262|That's the day job.
p310_263|It really is taken seriously.
p310_264|We have not given up hope.
p310_265|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
p310_266|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p310_267|It's such a trial!
p310_268|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p310_269|I think it is totally wrong.
p310_270|And a film maker was born.
p310_271|It was also put on the Internet.
p310_272|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
p310_273|And yet his legacy is doubtful.
p310_274|It seems to have worked.
p310_275|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p310_276|There was a battle there.
p310_277|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
p310_278|Well, when did he ever refuse?
p310_279|Today's ruling confirms that.
p310_280|It's good news and long overdue.
p310_281|THE atmosphere was electric.
p310_282|I'd never heard him in person before.
p310_283|We're going to change our party.
p310_284|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p310_285|I have learned a lot from him.
p310_286|Is he any good in the kitchen?
p310_287|He has been campaigning for change for years.
p310_288|A formal decision will be announced within months.
p310_289|He must have something up his sleeve.
p310_290|He was at home with his pals.
p310_291|We make good weapons.
p310_292|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
p310_293|This is not a Scottish problem.
p310_294|Then followed a bout of flu.
p310_295|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p310_296|That was the most annoying thing.
p310_297|We are being hijacked.
p310_298|We had no part in it.
p310_299|It wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
p310_300|Mike Tyson went to prison.
p310_301|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p310_302|Our young people are leaving.
p310_303|And there is no cause for it.
p310_304|That would have been too easy.
p310_305|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p310_306|This is not a faceless system.
p310_307|This is a long-term discussion paper.
p310_308|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p310_309|It is just like the stock market.
p310_310|The damage from the fire was huge.
p310_311|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p310_312|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p310_313|What, then, is the real thing?
p310_314|Boarding school was equally protective.
p310_315|Most people know that.
p310_316|It will be the final push.
p310_317|Clearly, this was the important nursing.
p310_318|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p310_319|The campaign was raucous.
p310_320|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p310_321|But both were involved with other matters.
p310_322|But we were wrong.
p310_323|The result today is an impasse.
p310_324|However, in October another partnership was announced.
p310_325|There is no threat to them.
p310_326|Nelson does not disappoint.
p310_327|The goal will stay with me forever.
p310_328|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p310_329|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p310_330|It is a high time to act.
p310_331|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p310_332|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p310_333|The South African defended his work ethic.
p310_334|We have a team to reach the final.
p310_335|There was barely a handful of chances.
p310_336|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
p310_337|I have found my vision.
p310_338|We don't know the scale of need.
p310_339|You need a reason for staying.
p310_340|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
p310_341|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p310_342|I don't expect to see that this time.
p310_343|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
p310_344|The big issue for us is the review.
p310_345|That is not the way we should operate.
p310_346|More likely, perhaps, it is that he will stay in England.
p310_347|The new work will begin in the autumn.
p310_348|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p310_349|He showed he has some things to learn.
p310_350|Or do they?
p310_351|They are the innocent victims.
p310_352|It is now time for justice.
p310_353|That is of no use.
p310_354|I could have been offended.
p310_355|Now it is measuring it in dollars.
p310_356|But he is frustrated at every turn.
p310_357|He was down the right, the left, and through the middle.
p310_358|This is the lowest of the low.
p310_359|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
p310_360|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
p310_361|He's a nice guy.
p310_362|The milk industry is in turmoil.
p310_363|I love the moment of being first.
p310_364|It is a decision which has paid off.
p310_365|Their mind was already made up.
p310_366|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p310_367|But it's got to be worth it.
p310_368|But does the same thing happen with music?
p310_369|I just couldn't believe what had happened.
p310_370|Alex is a big part of that future.
p310_371|Pray that is so.
p310_372|In fact it isn't related to either.
p310_373|There was support from across the board.
p310_374|There may be some evidence to this effect.
p310_375|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
p310_376|So what does one do?
p310_377|Such actions are rarely popular.
p310_378|The methadone programme is completely out of control.
p310_379|That is why it's so lyrical.
p310_380|I joined a group.
p310_381|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
p310_382|It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
p310_383|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p310_384|And they all had these other commitments.
p310_385|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
p310_386|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p310_387|They were unconfirmed reports that it was a cannabis.
p310_388|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p310_389|I never agreed with that.
p310_390|I didn't actually believe them at first.
p310_391|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p310_392|We knew their goalkeeper would take the chance.
p310_393|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p310_394|There was only one hole in it.
p310_395|I don't think it's vital.
p310_396|It might not survive the process.
p310_397|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p310_398|My father died in childbirth.
p310_399|The issue has still to be resolved.
p310_400|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p310_401|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p310_402|I'm happy to contribute to that.
p310_403|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p310_404|We were close, but not close enough.
p311_001|Please call Stella.
p311_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p311_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p311_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p311_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p311_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p311_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p311_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p311_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p311_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p311_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.
p311_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p311_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p311_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p311_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p311_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p311_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p311_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p311_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p311_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p311_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p311_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p311_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p311_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p311_025|No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
p311_026|It's ahead of Labour.
p311_027|It is the whole package.
p311_028|I was totally wrong.
p311_029|It was a matter of chance.
p311_030|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
p311_031|Miller was every bit as happy.
p311_032|We keep a distance.
p311_033|She went home from school and never returned.
p311_034|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p311_035|With actors it is slightly different.
p311_036|Green is desperate to play in The Open.
p311_037|They did a very good job.
p311_038|That's what we're still trying to do.
p311_039|He tried to stop it, but it was already too late.
p311_040|We cannot go on in this fashion.
p311_041|We must learn to finish.
p311_042|There can be no two ways about it.
p311_043|I knew my contract was up this year.
p311_044|I am content with the silver.
p311_045|People acted too quickly.
p311_046|My heart is with the artist.
p311_047|That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
p311_048|There are different cultures in different departments.
p311_049|What would you do if you didn't work?
p311_050|They are already on the way there.
p311_051|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p311_052|This is a holy place.
p311_053|We will miss him very much.
p311_054|As a nation, we must become more active.
p311_055|They should go ahead as normal.
p311_056|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
p311_057|It ended as it began, in confusion.
p311_058|I just went a bit too far.
p311_059|I am delighted for Simon.
p311_060|His third goal was superb.
p311_061|I don't have a problem with getting older.
p311_062|It has been declared.
p311_063|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
p311_064|The scientific debate is dead.
p311_065|Only one got through.
p311_066|In the end, however, it all came together.
p311_067|He is a visionary.
p311_068|I was the trial judge in both.
p311_069|I have a choice.
p311_070|It happens in many countries.
p311_071|It's not just about the shows.
p311_072|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p311_073|I have spoken to the skipper.
p311_074|Already the children are dying.
p311_075|Craig is a major concern for us.
p311_076|We don't do this for everyone, of course.
p311_077|I can't wait to meet him.
p311_078|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p311_079|It's the same as Glasgow.
p311_080|We've got a job to do.
p311_081|You just have to adjust.
p311_082|Well, that's just a third district.
p311_083|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
p311_084|They are there to help us.
p311_085|He added, We are not prepared for war.
p311_086|My wife and family are the support system.
p311_087|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p311_088|I have hardly any commitments.
p311_089|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p311_090|It is a very special place.
p311_091|Some things in life you have to accept.
p311_092|I am relishing the challenge.
p311_093|It is set in Paris.
p311_094|The party has never fully recovered.
p311_095|Everyone is working together to resolve the problems.
p311_096|Surely history will not repeat itself.
p311_097|The initial report has been completed.
p311_098|He's got me very well.
p311_099|It's like an extension of your body.
p311_100|It is quite a new prescription.
p311_101|Johnsen is equally concerned.
p311_102|Which he is, too.
p311_103|These matters are now behind us.
p311_104|But things are never the same again.
p311_105|It is easy to agree with him.
p311_106|He, too, will return.
p311_107|Is there anything in the wound?
p311_108|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p311_109|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p311_110|It is not really used by many people.
p311_111|There could be no dispute about our history.
p311_112|He has one son and one daughter.
p311_113|Don't get me wrong.
p311_114|It is nearly there.
p311_115|Otherwise we will pay the price.
p311_116|I find it rather oppressive.
p311_117|They are all Arabs.
p311_118|It is already making a difference.
p311_119|He decides to do something about it.
p311_120|There were no new cases yesterday.
p311_121|Someone else has now got them.
p311_122|But once again it was not converted.
p311_123|These figures are truly terrible.
p311_124|This is a most serious matter.
p311_125|I let go the telephone and ran.
p311_126|Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
p311_127|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
p311_128|It was a bit of a shock.
p311_129|The hearing was continued until a later date.
p311_130|Still, some additions are inspired.
p311_131|Planning is a key issue.
p311_132|Did he always want to be a comedian?
p311_133|The way ahead is not easy.
p311_134|I could do a better job.
p311_135|Yet what is supposed to be said?
p311_136|Parole isn't a decision for me.
p311_137|I get the bus.
p311_138|We are still the best team in Britain.
p311_139|They got the job done.
p311_140|It's a horrific incident.
p311_141|They have been contrasting years, certainly.
p311_142|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p311_143|We've not won anything yet.
p311_144|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p311_145|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
p311_146|They did not let him down.
p311_147|I believe in trade unions.
p311_148|This is in a league of its own.
p311_149|It's been such a waste of money.
p311_150|The money is not really our concern.
p311_151|You just know it.
p311_152|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p311_153|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
p311_154|We have the easy part.
p311_155|At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
p311_156|It's like a high school play.
p311_157|He was part of South Africa.
p311_158|It's there for people to look at.
p311_159|The party will make up its own mind.
p311_160|At least two women were among those arrested.
p311_161|They never got into the show this time.
p311_162|But no, it's not funny.
p311_163|In that case, the children were not missing.
p311_164|He changed my life.
p311_165|There was nothing else to match it.
p311_166|Two options are being proposed.
p311_167|They haven't been thought through.
p311_168|The criteria have changed.
p311_169|O, Is there a lot of blood?
p311_170|Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
p311_171|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p311_172|He was at home with his pals.
p311_173|This is a very interesting move.
p311_174|The highest rate is in Glasgow.
p311_175|His only reply was a laugh.
p311_176|those who are preparing to give up.
p311_177|What kind of festival is proposed?
p311_178|I was delighted with every one of them.
p311_179|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
p311_180|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
p311_181|That will help my case a bit.
p311_182|It was entirely justified.
p311_183|He looked at me before replying.
p311_184|This may be perfectly innocent.
p311_185|It feels that the game is off.
p311_186|There will be no change in government.
p311_187|Another man said, It was horrible.
p311_188|But we still don't know.
p311_189|Who do you think you are?
p311_190|Glasgow is a tour de force.
p311_191|I have no battle with the Scots.
p311_192|It is all credit to them today.
p311_193|I have done ever since it was published.
p311_194|Nobody could survive on that.
p311_195|They seem to turn up for them.
p311_196|They were kept there for a summer.
p311_197|He confirmed there had been no warning.
p311_198|It is that sort of film.
p311_199|She was not hard done by.
p311_200|Can you believe it?
p311_201|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p311_202|They are now out in the cold.
p311_203|However, planners should be taking the lead.
p311_204|I'm very frightened of the dark.
p311_205|Our message was inclusive.
p311_206|This has been a shock.
p311_207|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p311_208|Everything in the symphony is there.
p311_209|There has also been some Scots input.
p311_210|This time, he will be more on the defensive.
p311_211|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p311_212|But who will buy it?
p311_213|It had to be more flexible.
p311_214|Openness is always the best way.
p311_215|It wouldn't go off.
p311_216|It can be halted.
p311_217|This was a lot of numbers.
p311_218|Would it be good for the Nationwide League?
p311_219|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
p311_220|The whole thing has been a nightmare.
p311_221|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p311_222|The professor said the results were positive.
p311_223|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p311_224|But it's just great to have won.
p311_225|And it paid off.
p311_226|Gone with them is any sense of narrative.
p311_227|Those Were The Days, indeed.
p311_228|I never made any offer to Mark.
p311_229|It should be scrapped.
p311_230|He admitted the asylum system was not working.
p311_231|They are just trying to cover up.
p311_232|We have to defend ourselves.
p311_233|I came here this week to work.
p311_234|Where do we go from here?
p311_235|Barry Ferguson is one of them.
p311_236|He gets his moment.
p311_237|This was an option from the beginning.
p311_238|Clearly he is keeping in touch.
p311_239|It's not a party, no, no.
p311_240|It's not that clear-cut.
p311_241|It may not be life long.
p311_242|It was just above the roof.
p311_243|It has changed, and not for the better.
p311_244|However, that is a sizeable if.
p311_245|Everyone must be focused on the league.
p311_246|The English are coming.
p311_247|I believe in theatre.
p311_248|Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
p311_249|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
p311_250|It's time to say enough is enough.
p311_251|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p311_252|He has to pull back from the brink.
p311_253|She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
p311_254|That's my daughter acting.
p311_255|The film has also been superbly designed.
p311_256|The performance was really, really immense.
p311_257|Faces from the Eighties.
p311_258|The family baton is handed on.
p311_259|How can this be?
p311_260|We are still alive and kicking.
p311_261|I want to go now.
p311_262|There are many questions to be answered.
p311_263|Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
p311_264|All the children on the roll are genuine.
p311_265|They said we were out of touch.
p311_266|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p311_267|There is no signature.
p311_268|There is no point in denying that.
p311_269|The kids are paying the price.
p311_270|He said he was delighted by the award.
p311_271|They didn't find any substance.
p311_272|They still have the dirty work to do.
p311_273|I've never seen a game like it.
p311_274|It doesn't seem like that long ago.
p311_275|He will do very well.
p311_276|They also intend to travel today.
p311_277|There's a lot of hysteria.
p311_278|The casualties were not named.
p311_279|I was shaking on the blocks.
p311_280|There are two ways to start a festival.
p311_281|I am very happy with life.
p311_282|Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
p311_283|My office is down there.
p311_284|Even then this game was not over.
p311_285|Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.
p311_286|We also hope to meet the men.
p311_287|The defender made an impressive debut.
p311_288|It has become very confused.
p311_289|Fame and money followed.
p311_290|I am not in denial.
p311_291|Shelter also supports the reform.
p311_292|The attack was totally out of the blue.
p311_293|There is a solution, she believes.
p311_294|So there is a very real dilemma.
p311_295|I can't believe we didn't win that game.
p311_296|Then there's the Old Firm.
p311_297|I seem to keep this for the majors.
p311_298|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
p311_299|They're not always the same person.
p311_300|It would have to be backdated.
p311_301|He said he was sorry.
p311_302|My position on the euro is quite clear.
p311_303|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p311_304|We have worked well with them for years.
p311_305|That was me today.
p311_306|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p311_307|That is when we are really effective.
p311_308|The director's a genius.
p311_309|There was no sign that anything was amiss.
p311_310|It was the climax of the thing.
p311_311|This is new money.
p311_312|We have not given up on the game.
p311_313|The decision was left entirely to him.
p311_314|Yes, it was uplifting.
p311_315|Nobody should believe this story.
p311_316|This is not out of choice.
p311_317|But don't just take my word, for it.
p311_318|But this one has a lot of potential.
p311_319|It's a big challenge for the audience.
p311_320|We'll see what happens.
p311_321|This was another video cassette.
p311_322|If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
p311_323|It will make a huge difference.
p311_324|He pretended not to care.
p311_325|Not because they want to sing about something.
p311_326|I was in tears in the street.
p311_327|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
p311_328|No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.
p311_329|But that's not the idea behind this article.
p311_330|If he could've prevented it happening, he would have.
p311_331|That is why we are here.
p311_332|The German had a point to make.
p311_333|This time, however, may have been different.
p311_334|You have to feel for the guy.
p311_335|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p311_336|Bomber was not amused.
p311_337|They would have been forgiven for doing so.
p311_338|Was it just negligent.
p311_339|And suddenly it became a free-for-all.
p311_340|This Government is cutting taxes.
p311_341|Things don't look too good at the moment.
p311_342|This is a big club.
p311_343|I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
p311_344|They will now get that support.
p311_345|I feel it's time to make the switch.
p311_346|It seemed so personal.
p311_347|I've no problem with what they said.
p311_348|He added that he felt undermined.
p311_349|I think we have got the balance right.
p311_350|Eriksson would have approved.
p311_351|It is physical but it is also good.
p311_352|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
p311_353|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p311_354|So it goes on.
p311_355|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p311_356|I hope they will understand the reasons.
p311_357|They should have listened to me.
p311_358|I am greatly encouraged.
p311_359|It was like someone had died.
p311_360|What does he want him to look like?
p311_361|The actors are confident and polished.
p311_362|I hope he would have been very pleased.
p311_363|We would have concerns about that.
p311_364|Taxes may need to rise.
p311_365|It's unusual to say the least.
p311_366|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p311_367|Our Great Depression is our lives.
p311_368|I just did not cope with the pressure.
p311_369|We have some concerns.
p311_370|So he was anxious to try something new.
p311_371|This was a chilling echo.
p311_372|They really want to do it.
p311_373|And then he laughs.
p311_374|I recommend a tour.
p311_375|We don't ask for much.
p311_376|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
p311_377|I had a wonderful time working with him.
p311_378|We have to start again on Saturday.
p311_379|It feels like a winner already.
p311_380|And it covers the spectrum.
p311_381|The replacements made a big difference.
p311_382|And the winners are.
p311_383|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
p311_384|He didn't really, we just made that up.
p311_385|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p311_386|There are big names.
p311_387|My players are precious to me.
p311_388|That argument has been won.
p311_389|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p311_390|For us, that decision was hard to understand.
p311_391|I had to calm down.
p311_392|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p311_393|She returned home a few days later.
p311_394|They haven't run away.
p311_395|Nobody can take it away from me.
p311_396|She is fulfilled by it.
p311_397|He said no survivors had been found.
p311_398|Who can say?
p311_399|It is the end of an era.
p311_400|In short, the club was broke.
p311_401|Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
p311_402|She is a veteran in the Balkans.
p311_403|The men are safe and unharmed.
p312_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p312_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p312_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p312_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p312_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p312_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p312_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p312_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p312_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p312_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p312_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p312_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p312_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p312_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p312_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p312_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p312_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p312_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p312_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbows have been formed.
p312_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increase as the size of the drops increases.
p312_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p312_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p312_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p312_025|Perhaps that was their mistake.
p312_026|This was a rationing decision.
p312_027|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p312_028|He is doing the right things.
p312_029|Blood samples were taken.
p312_030|I've got the poster.
p312_031|This is excellent news for the workforce.
p312_032|We have a high quality product.
p312_033|Haven't been so lucky since.
p312_034|Well, you might have a point.
p312_035|It was quite distressing for the crew.
p312_036|Now the show is for public consumption.
p312_037|That decision is now being appealed.
p312_038|This is really good news for us.
p312_039|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
p312_040|Not so, it transpires.
p312_041|I shouldn't have put up with it.
p312_042|I think so - he seems to be in good health.
p312_043|I think it must be the uniforms.
p312_044|This is not a monument to the past.
p312_045|I certainly hope not.
p312_046|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
p312_047|I feel pretty good.
p312_048|The group will report back in the summer.
p312_049|Back then it was hard to refuse.
p312_050|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p312_051|I was in the zone in the morning.
p312_052|We have to break that cycle.
p312_053|In fact, it might just be the beginning.
p312_054|The children are being very brave.
p312_055|They have a car and cannot afford another.
p312_056|My only concern is for my children.
p312_057|This is welcome news.
p312_058|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p312_059|The trust has no magic wand.
p312_060|We just wish they had done so before.
p312_061|It was a virus.
p312_062|The rest, of course, is history.
p312_063|They chose the latter.
p312_064|I've not said anything to them, they know.
p312_065|All were later allowed home.
p312_066|Will you just put it away?
p312_067|I think it's more important to have fun.
p312_068|Who did the recruiting?
p312_069|It is still with Ministers.
p312_070|The effect was almost magical.
p312_071|It happened again, and again, and again.
p312_072|It showed him the way to drive.
p312_073|I am still waiting for a reply.
p312_074|After this, they were always in the driving seat.
p312_075|Were they under-age?
p312_076|He was charged with perjury.
p312_077|I started it, but then forgot all about it.
p312_078|However, there would be no permanent displays.
p312_079|The goal will come.
p312_080|He could hardly have been in greater demand.
p312_081|We didn't take our chances.
p312_082|It was all very proper and civilised.
p312_083|I've played them all in the Champions League.
p312_084|There are many children.
p312_085|That never seemed likely.
p312_086|Action must be taken urgently.
p312_087|I was brought up in a mining background.
p312_088|Either system could have prevented the crash.
p312_089|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
p312_090|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p312_091|But these things are happening now.
p312_092|I am very encouraged by this poll.
p312_093|They should be swept away.
p312_094|They thought the set-up there was unfair.
p312_095|It will be a challenging film.
p312_096|The test case is still awaiting action.
p312_097|What happens next?
p312_098|He added, The old system has reached its limits.
p312_099|We could easily be cut again.
p312_100|The plot is minimal.
p312_101|The scheme is hopelessly failing.
p312_102|They're just a nonsense.
p312_103|There may be some resistance.
p312_104|I could not believe it.
p312_105|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p312_106|The Rangers think they have problems.
p312_107|He will go a long way.
p312_108|Then there was her childhood.
p312_109|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p312_110|I thought that all musicians were the same.
p312_111|It's so much more fun.
p312_112|I believe he could have turned it around.
p312_113|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
p312_114|Where do you think she is going?
p312_115|This looks like it's anything but open.
p312_116|I am not against a further inquiry.
p312_117|Such is the scene of the tragedy.
p312_118|It's a double whammy.
p312_119|What's the theme?
p312_120|We are satisfied that this is the case.
p312_121|For me, it was a shattering experience.
p312_122|This latter suggestion is very important.
p312_123|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p312_124|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p312_125|There was some merit in that.
p312_126|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p312_127|What's wrong with that?
p312_128|The pain is still acute.
p312_129|His remit is specific.
p312_130|It is a very big problem.
p312_131|Frustration is not the word.
p312_132|The police have to act to help them.
p312_133|She was extremely rigid.
p312_134|It may be down, but New York is not out.
p312_135|But what lies ahead?
p312_136|I am so upset.
p312_137|I was blown out of proportion.
p312_138|There was a definite prejudice.
p312_139|It's the same with us.
p312_140|It's an awful lot of money.
p312_141|He was the architect.
p312_142|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p312_143|It's a fantastic achievement.
p312_144|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
p312_145|He, too, was not satisfied.
p312_146|It's easy to see why.
p312_147|I've never regretted coming here.
p312_148|He is in a lot of pain, it's very distressing.
p312_149|I am so, so, so lucky.
p312_150|We still have a long, long way to go.
p312_151|I fell into it by accident.
p312_152|I only wanted to give her a fright.
p312_153|Where does it come from?
p312_154|Norman was not doing so bad, either.
p312_155|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
p312_156|It is almost certain to be the last.
p312_157|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p312_158|That says something for his strength of character.
p312_159|The world is being invited to visit.
p312_160|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
p312_161|I think it's a sensible change.
p312_162|Sex is fun?
p312_163|I'm not sure.
p312_164|His first album was a hit.
p312_165|He had played well in that central role.
p312_166|And who would argue with that?
p312_167|It was visibly on fire.
p312_168|What's it for, after all?
p312_169|Who would be out there, singing?
p312_170|A number of people could not speak English.
p312_171|They have got off with murder.
p312_172|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p312_173|This remains the party's policy.
p312_174|I cannot say anymore.
p312_175|They want this research to continue.
p312_176|Robert is a special talent.
p312_177|They are going to carry it through.
p312_178|It was very, very dejected.
p312_179|You can't keep them separate.
p312_180|I think it can count against you now.
p312_181|He was a legend.
p312_182|That's when the story first appeared.
p312_183|You're going to die.
p312_184|There was a substantial explosion.
p312_185|He will continue to provide support for them.
p312_186|I'm going to see my friend.
p312_187|We played too deeply.
p312_188|I probably would have been a dancer.
p312_189|There is a lot of heroin about.
p312_190|We're going to see a Government in a hurry.
p312_191|He never asked me for money.
p312_192|I was a bit nervous.
p312_193|There was no question of him not impressing.
p312_194|However, we came through.
p312_195|I love this tournament.
p312_196|He had a heart problem.
p312_197|I am desperate to play for Scotland.
p312_198|It is a large number.
p312_199|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p312_200|Hear what they have to say.
p312_201|Now there's a thought.
p312_202|I believe that the answer is simple.
p312_203|That, he claimed, was essential.
p312_204|I was on the pitch and everything.
p312_205|They told him to go to drama school.
p312_206|Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
p312_207|Let us hope so.
p312_208|She looked very settled.
p312_209|Of course he was right!
p312_210|The next few months will tell.
p312_211|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p312_212|But my daughter has got nothing.
p312_213|You can see their point.
p312_214|Nobody, if he has anything to do with it.
p312_215|The dangers are very obvious.
p312_216|There were no casualties.
p312_217|Is it in the right place?
p312_218|I played well in my time there.
p312_219|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p312_220|They are still going to be impulsive.
p312_221|I love you so very much.
p312_222|The scheme was simple but extremely effective.
p312_223|He is a very nice man.
p312_224|We want to sort it out.
p312_225|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
p312_226|Such a city does not exist.
p312_227|It made me determined to get back.
p312_228|It was no avail.
p312_229|We're going to see more extreme weather.
p312_230|He was replaced by John Spencer.
p312_231|Of course, we have to be very concerned about that.
p312_232|That is in the very nature of farming.
p312_233|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
p312_234|It was worth the wait.
p312_235|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p312_236|It will take place in July.
p312_237|We must not give in to the bastards.
p312_238|This is a major step forward for carers.
p312_239|I think it was his parents.
p312_240|Our commitment is to move forward.
p312_241|Partly, it is his own fault.
p312_242|It's a personal matter.
p312_243|That's where it all started.
p312_244|I won't go back.
p312_245|Why has it taken so long?
p312_246|You make the choice.
p312_247|And does it?
p312_248|I was proud of our lads.
p312_249|These will finally be corrected by next week.
p312_250|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
p312_251|All would be under threat.
p312_252|Was it a foul?
p312_253|He leaves a beat.
p312_254|Perhaps it was her demeanour.
p312_255|It lasted longer than we thought.
p312_256|Promises were not kept.
p312_257|It hasn't happened, but other things have.
p312_258|The claim was denied by first minister.
p312_259|Who is he?
p312_260|It has to be long-term commitment.
p312_261|It was that bad, that low.
p312_262|That would be a big mistake.
p312_263|His arrival could be the making of them.
p312_264|After all, this is the start of the giving age.
p312_265|I said How much?
p312_266|You are a liar.
p312_267|The scheme has been funded by the Government.
p312_268|We're still talking about it.
p312_269|She would say he was still the best.
p312_270|He finished the night in a cell.
p312_271|I'm not afraid of that.
p312_272|I don't know what he was shouting.
p312_273|It is the icing on the cake.
p312_274|It was a new ball game.
p312_275|The people here are quite reserved.
p312_276|Previously police had said that schools were safe.
p312_277|Our legal advice is clear.
p312_278|The past is history, not destiny.
p312_279|These were the edited highlights.
p312_280|All were within range of Israeli cities.
p312_281|They were totally behind it.
p312_282|However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.
p312_283|We could do a lot worse.
p312_284|Knowledge is everything at this level.
p312_285|Inquiries are ongoing into this incident.
p312_286|It is all one-sided.
p312_287|In the end, that was enough to beat England.
p312_288|That was the initial attraction.
p312_289|Who will take them after that?
p312_290|He's also thinking long-term.
p312_291|A kinder but effective treatment would be welcomed.
p312_292|Trevor has been great.
p312_293|It would also take time.
p312_294|Rather than answer, she resigned.
p312_295|She said No, he's not in Elgin today.
p312_296|I was first in the door.
p312_297|It is highly unlikely.
p312_298|Bill is a mentor.
p312_299|The atmosphere is businesslike.
p312_300|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
p312_301|There will be no exceptions to this rule.
p312_302|What makes a house a home?
p312_303|Destruction came from within.
p312_304|I think however, he was having a fit!
p312_305|It is good to look back.
p312_306|You can't do one without the other.
p312_307|Obviously we want to stop the rot.
p312_308|Chris Paterson was outstanding.
p312_309|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p312_310|I would say so.
p312_311|It's not the end of the matter, of course.
p312_312|Sub Not Used, McKay.
p312_313|And they did just that.
p312_314|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
p312_315|She has left the island.
p312_316|They had three children.
p312_317|Our system is archaic.
p312_318|She had kept the news from him.
p312_319|We want to know about the policy.
p312_320|It is not illegal.
p312_321|I wouldn't say this is normal.
p312_322|We don't have the credible evidence.
p312_323|That will be the case on Tuesday.
p312_324|It's one up to the Scots.
p312_325|This is complete nonsense.
p312_326|I don't want to use the term.
p312_327|There is still hope.
p312_328|It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
p312_329|It's all happening at a local level.
p312_330|She is a great talent.
p312_331|It's the big omission.
p312_332|We do things in an appropriate way.
p312_334|However, she is female, and so.
p312_335|The playing is perfectly turned out.
p312_336|He will be advised by me.
p312_337|But he did not rule out further talks.
p312_338|It's part of your life.
p312_339|He had a horror.
p312_340|We're delighted and we certainly deserved it.
p312_341|This time we may not be seeking volunteers.
p312_342|That was the biggest game of my life.
p312_343|This is perfectly legal.
p312_344|That's the most important thing for me.
p312_345|Then came the second round.
p312_346|Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
p312_347|Saddam is not threatening this country.
p312_348|We told them in June.
p312_349|Parents should avoid it.
p312_350|It was not a difficult decision, he said.
p312_351|It was a horrible thing to happen.
p312_352|And she's not even in the book!
p312_353|Of course it's a bunch of trouble.
p312_354|I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
p312_355|He, too, is killing.
p312_356|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
p312_357|It's better to be happy.
p312_358|It's just so sad.
p312_359|We have lost the round, but not the fight.
p312_360|And Scotland is no different.
p312_361|It's been an extremely frustrating year for me.
p312_362|We are in a learning curve.
p312_363|He can do everything.
p312_364|She was just that sort of person.
p312_365|Is it a warning to parents?
p312_366|You've gotten all the facts.
p312_367|And it will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p312_368|Soon the whole country will be level.
p312_369|And huge, indeed, it is.
p312_370|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p312_371|Attack appears to be the biggest concern.
p312_372|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
p312_373|He said he needed no more evidence.
p312_374|It's such a tragedy.
p312_375|It was a long time coming.
p312_376|Gordon Brown was superb.
p312_377|The referee didn't do his job.
p312_378|We are very nearly there.
p312_379|Stand by for action.
p312_380|Barry will be able to handle this.
p312_381|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p312_382|The urgency is real.
p312_383|They have been for some time now.
p312_384|It was only logical to end it.
p312_385|Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
p312_386|I've no passion for any country.
p312_387|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
p312_388|Nobody ever gets to see them.
p312_389|That's an old idea.
p312_390|It is part and parcel of it.
p312_391|The only safe investment is cash.
p312_392|It's the whole season.
p312_393|We had no choice but to go down.
p312_394|We are keen to have him back.
p312_395|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
p312_396|Of course, it was very passionate in Glasgow.
p312_397|And we all understand that.
p312_398|The new incitement offence will cover all religions.
p312_399|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
p313_001|Please call Stella.
p313_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p313_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p313_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p313_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p313_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p313_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p313_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p313_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p313_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p313_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p313_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p313_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p313_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p313_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p313_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p313_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p313_018|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p313_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p313_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p313_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the sizes of the drops increases.
p313_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
p313_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p313_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p313_025|They will be dealt with.
p313_026|It is never an easy game.
p313_027|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p313_028|I intend to raise the matter there.
p313_029|However, it's good to turn the page.
p313_030|We have to put this behind us.
p313_031|I thought it was quite good.
p313_032|It was important to win the singles.
p313_033|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p313_034|That is impressive by any standards.
p313_035|We are doing very well as we are.
p313_036|The waiting is over, well almost.
p313_037|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
p313_038|I'm not allowed to say that, of course.
p313_039|It helped me to get noticed.
p313_040|They hit me in the head.
p313_041|But he is not using them.
p313_042|That, though, was just the start of it.
p313_043|We are not moving in.
p313_044|We have not had a formal request.
p313_045|I never had a childhood.
p313_046|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p313_047|We offered something different.
p313_048|We were very much a happy family.
p313_049|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p313_050|My brother's buried under there.
p313_051|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p313_052|What were they?
p313_053|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p313_054|He will be judged by his actions.
p313_055|Her role in it was small.
p313_056|I've really noticed that this week.
p313_057|We might be back next year.
p313_058|In a way he was.
p313_059|It's back to how it used to be.
p313_060|It is not a standing army.
p313_061|The firm was down and almost out.
p313_062|They said they were only young men.
p313_063|I was chosen to do this.
p313_064|I learned a lot from that.
p313_065|The house was so well alight.
p313_066|He got his degree.
p313_067|Sandy was very active.
p313_068|However, there is great potential in this right.
p313_069|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p313_070|I'm confident of the outcome this week.
p313_071|There were no formal announcements.
p313_072|Before the games it was pretty open.
p313_073|It really has left the town in shock.
p313_074|But you can go beyond that condition.
p313_075|I'm so worried about the roads.
p313_076|This was much worse.
p313_077|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p313_078|We are confident of taking that back.
p313_079|They must be kept on the ground.
p313_080|Did they give any good advice?
p313_081|Who wants to be a millionaire?
p313_082|This does not help.
p313_083|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p313_084|That's why the ministers resigned.
p313_085|He has lost confidence and weight.
p313_086|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p313_087|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p313_088|This could be her way forward.
p313_089|This gives us a lot of practice.
p313_090|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p313_091|It's a very, very special day.
p313_092|The crucial strike was yet to come.
p313_093|There's also the point.
p313_094|It was forced to divert.
p313_095|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p313_096|That's the National Grid.
p313_097|But Allen is deadly serious.
p313_098|Peter doesn't want to leave.
p313_099|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p313_100|They've just got to believe in themselves.
p313_101|This is my personal assessment.
p313_102|There was no trouble at all.
p313_103|Although, you never know.
p313_104|We shall be victorious.
p313_105|The quality of work is very impressive.
p313_106|However, he added there were signs of progress.
p313_107|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p313_108|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p313_109|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p313_110|I took the gun.
p313_111|It's just one of those things.
p313_112|A web site is planned for November.
p313_113|We played so well at times.
p313_114|I was very fortunate.
p313_115|Such a policy would be a disaster.
p313_116|We act because we must.
p313_117|They will be destroyed.
p313_118|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p313_119|O Neill is reputed to have replied.
p313_120|The Tory party will last.
p313_121|It was a journey into a new life.
p313_122|It's a way of making a mark.
p313_123|There is a great carry over value.
p313_124|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p313_125|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p313_126|What's the point?
p313_127|Why is this?
p313_128|What has changed since then?
p313_129|Raymond was always on the outside.
p313_130|We need to make more inquiries about that.
p313_131|I'd love to be at the World Cup.
p313_132|He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
p313_133|I'm sorry to hear this news.
p313_134|At some point, the bill will be presented.
p313_135|I mean it happens.
p313_136|This week is a perfect example.
p313_137|This performance has given my confidence a boost.
p313_138|Receiving this medal is an honour.
p313_139|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p313_140|But every two minutes it was exploding.
p313_141|That sort of thing is long gone.
p313_142|It's typical of me.
p313_143|However, consumers may take a different view.
p313_144|They played it like a cup final.
p313_145|However, it's not all bad news for women.
p313_146|But the championship is not over yet.
p313_147|We haven't found out anything different.
p313_148|A review of the decision is being sought.
p313_149|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
p313_150|Still, in the end, it was a fair result.
p313_151|Surely it can do better than that?
p313_152|I am ashamed of them.
p313_153|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
p313_154|The salary changes are long overdue.
p313_155|I, like an idiot, agreed.
p313_156|If so, we want to hear from them.
p313_157|I'm not blaming audiences.
p313_158|Who was on the panel?
p313_159|They may differ on other issues.
p313_160|He'd never run the distance before.
p313_161|I can make one further announcement.
p313_162|The General Election is all to play for.
p313_163|It was a fiery game.
p313_164|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p313_165|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p313_166|Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.
p313_167|It will not be easy for him.
p313_168|This one is a special case.
p313_169|But what are the songs about?
p313_170|There is a simmering anger out there.
p313_171|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p313_172|That is not a position they enjoy.
p313_173|The stadium was full.
p313_174|Dewar is the medium.
p313_175|It was that kind of night.
p313_176|It is very much a matter for them.
p313_177|Perhaps it is jealousy.
p313_178|Any error is severely punished.
p313_179|He's got a great chance of making it.
p313_180|We won't do that.
p313_181|I hope we do.
p313_182|From now on there is no hiding place.
p313_183|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p313_184|He quit in October.
p313_185|The United Nations must act.
p313_186|Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
p313_187|Her daughter is getting married.
p313_188|His manager blamed the referee.
p313_189|They were that poor.
p313_190|Patients will be partners in decision making.
p313_191|We have understood the problems for some time.
p313_192|Stan is a vital part of our future.
p313_193|All these things have an impact.
p313_194|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p313_195|They believed it worked.
p313_196|After that, though, we're still waiting to see.
p313_197|They should feel ashamed.
p313_198|This is a really serious issue.
p313_199|So they will settle again.
p313_200|How do we get more people in?
p313_201|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p313_202|It looks as though there is no chance.
p313_203|This is not a European Army.
p313_204|Election results are expected soon.
p313_205|So she told him.
p313_206|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p313_207|There are moments of honesty, too.
p313_208|It was good to score the goal today.
p313_209|The night is young.
p313_210|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
p313_211|I suspect that it will.
p313_212|But there's no eye contact.
p313_213|The squad will be the same for France.
p313_214|We are a party for people, not against people.
p313_215|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p313_216|We're still paying the price for that.
p313_217|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
p313_218|It's not a wish list.
p313_219|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
p313_220|Some of the players have not progressed.
p313_221|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
p313_222|If not, he should go home.
p313_223|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
p313_224|There is no margin for error.
p313_225|This was not an easy meeting for me.
p313_226|From our point of view, it's the right time.
p313_227|That figure will always remain with me.
p313_228|And then a funny thing happened.
p313_229|It doesn't take much.
p313_230|She asked us a lot of questions.
p313_231|It was a stunning strike.
p313_232|It is a technique.
p313_233|They hold on for many years.
p313_234|Is it the shape of things to come?
p313_235|My body is exhausted.
p313_236|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p313_237|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
p313_238|There is nothing to fear.
p313_239|I was an athlete.
p313_240|Life was like a timetable.
p313_241|World leaders expressed their sympathy.
p313_242|I tried to push him away.
p313_243|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p313_244|This was done by the council staff.
p313_245|The truth is otherwise.
p313_246|We haven't come out of this very well.
p313_247|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p313_248|I thought they could have made the gesture.
p313_249|We should be rewarded for producing.
p313_250|The bottom line is that this must stop.
p313_251|Which, in effect, it is.
p313_252|The man became a reporter.
p313_253|It is a memorial.
p313_254|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p313_255|Our people are paying high prices.
p313_256|The reason is partly because of tradition.
p313_257|Nor is it likely to do so.
p313_258|Or so everyone believed.
p313_259|Perhaps we should do the same.
p313_260|I read it every year.
p313_261|He was in contention almost every week.
p313_262|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p313_263|It's up to Ann.
p313_264|We are playing them at their own game.
p313_265|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p313_266|I had trouble with the producers.
p313_267|So, it took me back to boarding school.
p313_268|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p313_269|The conference is the first test.
p313_270|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p313_271|I expect a rapid response.
p313_272|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p313_273|There is no more money.
p313_274|My mother is a widow.
p313_275|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p313_276|There have been different reports from different people.
p313_277|It's an absolute disgrace.
p313_278|Something was plainly wrong.
p313_279|Why should he go anywhere?
p313_280|One thing is sure.
p313_281|It was a foolhardy decision.
p313_282|I'm confident we can do that.
p313_283|Funding needs to be long term.
p313_284|It's funny how it comes and goes.
p313_285|I would never even consider it.
p313_286|We're talking about the outskirts of London.
p313_287|The end result is precisely the same.
p313_288|We have it on video.
p313_289|I'm not a threat to coaches.
p313_290|Painful, but only because it's true.
p313_291|It's never over until it's over.
p313_292|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
p313_293|This year, it was a little different.
p313_294|That, though, is to miss the point.
p313_295|We gave them the goal.
p313_296|Is being naturally funny enough?
p313_297|What's the point of staying sober?
p313_298|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p313_299|The incident is being taken seriously.
p313_300|So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
p313_301|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
p313_302|I can feel the sound inside.
p313_303|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p313_304|I'm not a fan of books.
p313_305|SO now we know the secret.
p313_306|It may well have been.
p313_307|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p313_308|It was a simple question.
p313_309|I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
p313_310|And we've beaten them before.
p313_311|Could you put it in writing?
p313_312|I'm not a paedophile.
p313_313|Some of their movement was excellent.
p313_314|But they had to be paid for.
p313_315|The odds are that it will.
p313_316|But then they scored their fourth.
p313_317|They deserve a lot of credit.
p313_318|That's the position that the MoD has adopted.
p313_319|Why is that?
p313_320|Then came the crunch.
p313_321|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p313_322|But will they fall in love?
p313_323|As if they ever stopped.
p313_324|The referee had a shocking game.
p313_325|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
p313_326|For a few years we had good fun.
p313_327|Medical staff are with them at the moment.
p313_328|It went on to become an annual event.
p313_329|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p313_330|We are now in an election period.
p313_331|Everyone's too upset to comment.
p313_332|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p313_333|But when we do it is great.
p313_334|She has nothing to say to journalists.
p313_335|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p313_336|He pleaded for caution.
p313_339|I can't believe the buzz.
p313_340|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p313_341|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p313_342|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
p313_343|It's no less intriguing, however.
p313_344|It's a question of perception.
p313_345|Staff have been informed.
p313_346|My heart is not so sure.
p313_347|This morning was very quiet.
p313_348|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
p313_349|It's been handled entirely properly.
p313_350|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p313_351|That might help a bit.
p313_352|Two others were also seriously injured.
p313_353|He was made redundant in February of last year.
p313_354|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p313_355|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p313_356|You've obviously got an answer to it.
p313_357|It seems very odd.
p313_358|Closure is not one of them.
p313_359|The hotel was huge.
p313_360|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p313_361|Well, you can have a tree.
p313_362|It was the same at Twickenham.
p313_363|This is an internal matter.
p313_364|I'm amazed at what he's done.
p313_365|They took a risk.
p313_366|The idea was presented to me.
p313_367|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p313_368|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p313_369|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p313_370|The hearing was fair.
p313_371|I see it as my job.
p313_372|This was not a summit about the euro.
p313_373|Frank Warren is a great man.
p313_374|I'm a little bit tired.
p313_375|That was never their agenda.
p313_376|She died at her home.
p313_377|She's currently in foster care.
p313_378|That's the only thing that matters.
p313_379|I enjoy the creative process.
p313_380|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p313_381|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p313_382|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
p313_383|It's always the same, isn't it?
p313_384|We have been preparing all year.
p313_385|We could learn a lot from them.
p313_386|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p313_387|Sure, we have problems.
p313_388|I was released after six days.
p313_389|That time is not far away.
p313_390|I may think about performing it.
p313_391|There are a number of possible outcomes.
p313_392|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p313_393|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p313_394|You can't go back and change things.
p313_395|It's time to fight a decisive battle.
p313_396|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p313_397|Instead, it's back to the drawing board.
p313_398|He says it often enough.
p313_399|Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.
p313_400|His primary residence is Scotland.
p313_401|I found that much more challenging.
p313_402|This fight is not going to go away.
p313_403|It would have been very easily done.
p314_001|Please call Stella.
p314_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p314_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p314_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p314_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p314_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p314_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p314_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p314_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p314_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p314_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p314_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p314_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p314_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p314_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p314_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p314_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p314_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p314_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p314_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p314_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p314_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p314_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p314_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p314_025|The Scots are, however, in good company.
p314_026|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
p314_027|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p314_028|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p314_029|Four other charges were dropped.
p314_030|I believe in the Church.
p314_031|We are just being flooded.
p314_032|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
p314_033|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p314_034|It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.
p314_035|Well, what do you know?
p314_036|But she was very human.
p314_037|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p314_038|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p314_039|His concern is only for the future.
p314_040|We have reacted well to each other.
p314_041|Pupils and staff were sent home early.
p314_042|It is all about people being assaulted, abused.
p314_043|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
p314_044|In fact, he didn't deliver a speech at the awards.
p314_045|He will emerge as a world leader.
p314_046|That view has not altered.
p314_047|I only half believe it.
p314_048|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p314_049|All the oil companies are talking together.
p314_050|We have no choice but to shut down.
p314_051|I'm feeling pretty good.
p314_052|The prognosis is excellent.
p314_053|Rangers deserved to beat us.
p314_054|That, though, is the measure of the man.
p314_055|It was developed in the Gulf War.
p314_056|Sub Not Used, MacKay.
p314_057|It is not normal practice.
p314_058|But he just carried on anyway.
p314_059|The spirit in the squad is certainly good.
p314_060|What happens next?
p314_061|I would not want to be young again.
p314_062|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p314_063|I'm astonished the men were not injured.
p314_064|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p314_065|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p314_066|They were later discharged from hospital.
p314_067|Let's see that increase over the years.
p314_068|I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
p314_069|They knew they shouldn't have been there.
p314_070|These findings would be made public.
p314_071|It's the most beautiful place on earth.
p314_072|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
p314_073|You can't go on forever.
p314_074|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p314_075|So far this season this approach is working.
p314_076|I have got a knife.
p314_077|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p314_078|What did we learn?
p314_079|I go home only once.
p314_080|I'm not going to answer that right now.
p314_081|It had a gigantic effect.
p314_082|On that basis, he would set it aside.
p314_083|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p314_084|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
p314_085|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
p314_086|The team this year is going places.
p314_087|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p314_088|We should do everything at a stroke.
p314_089|He had a moustache.
p314_090|He has changed my life for ever.
p314_091|It plans to return to this field.
p314_092|He said because people had invited him.
p314_093|Action must be taken urgently.
p314_094|They are completely different from each other.
p314_095|The money is not really our concern.
p314_096|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p314_097|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p314_098|I came up through the ranks.
p314_099|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p314_100|His team management was protective.
p314_101|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p314_102|The proposal was rejected.
p314_103|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p314_104|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p314_105|That would be even more disastrous.
p314_106|These guys will not lie down.
p314_107|You can expect a hell of a fuss.
p314_108|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p314_109|That is nearly four people every day.
p314_110|There are nine people here now.
p314_111|Is my wife a racist?
p314_112|It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
p314_113|This would not be my first choice.
p314_114|His wife Margaret was not in court.
p314_115|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p314_116|Which perhaps is just as well.
p314_117|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p314_118|He would just say it was terrible.
p314_119|They have got their position, we have got our position.
p314_120|That's not fair to the supporters.
p314_121|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p314_122|But the killer remains at large.
p314_123|It is a great shame.
p314_124|There are a lot of examples.
p314_125|But it will backfire.
p314_126|But then he changed his mind.
p314_127|I really hope he thinks that through.
p314_128|Police were also perplexed.
p314_129|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p314_130|It's very tragic and traumatic.
p314_131|For me, it's a tension you can feel.
p314_132|That's a huge amount.
p314_133|The final stage is paranoia.
p314_134|I'm not holding the club to ransom.
p314_135|Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
p314_136|Folk music is in her blood.
p314_137|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p314_138|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p314_139|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
p314_140|I would love it.
p314_141|This is the high point of my career.
p314_142|That's the sort of game you want.
p314_143|My duty is to win.
p314_144|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p314_145|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p314_146|Now we look forward to it.
p314_147|There is no such thing.
p314_148|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p314_149|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p314_150|It was a moment of madness.
p314_151|Don't even bother applying.
p314_152|But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
p314_153|We like being the underdogs.
p314_154|We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
p314_155|But we are not immune to the problem.
p314_156|Racism has no place in any sport.
p314_157|It's all too short term.
p314_158|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
p314_159|We must move on.
p314_160|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p314_161|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p314_162|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p314_163|I'd say we should give it a week.
p314_164|The elections should have no role in this.
p314_165|I should not be able to stand.
p314_166|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p314_167|Little Voice is on general release.
p314_168|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p314_169|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p314_170|They've got to get better.
p314_171|He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
p314_172|This is good news for the Western Isles.
p314_173|We've got the top three.
p314_174|I was never alone with her, right?
p314_175|There is no substitute.
p314_176|That nation is South Africa.
p314_177|This will secure the future of our industry.
p314_178|It's just a normal life.
p314_179|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p314_180|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
p314_181|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p314_182|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p314_183|He is the example for all of us.
p314_184|There is no way to do this.
p314_185|It was an empowering journey.
p314_186|Clearly we were looking at this very carefully.
p314_187|I certainly do not agree with that.
p314_188|It was a disaster of a race.
p314_189|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
p314_190|No, it's never been mentioned.
p314_191|They had been together for about three years.
p314_192|O Neill has delivered.
p314_193|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p314_194|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p314_195|Our customers come first.
p314_196|We will reform the welfare state.
p314_197|It may be his last for a while, too.
p314_198|His director of football is leaving.
p314_199|Mixing drugs and alcohol can be extremely dangerous.
p314_200|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
p314_201|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
p314_202|We don't want to be too intrusive.
p314_203|We just want to get stuck in now.
p314_204|Drugs are getting through.
p314_205|Do you come from Moscow?
p314_206|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p314_207|That night was a terrible muddle.
p314_208|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p314_209|You saw the football.
p314_210|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p314_211|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
p314_212|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p314_213|I am a little bit tired.
p314_214|Broke the birdie record.
p314_215|We have an attorney on the ground.
p314_216|I looked forward to it.
p314_217|That was a disgraceful performance.
p314_218|I'd come back from London.
p314_219|That it is a brand name.
p314_220|She was an only child.
p314_221|The text is reduced to bubbles.
p314_222|They should come forward.
p314_223|We don't say there was a massacre.
p314_224|John Lennon is a very large industry.
p314_225|The island will never recover.
p314_226|That is not an easy thing.
p314_227|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p314_228|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
p314_229|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p314_230|It is a court case.
p314_231|She was a delightful person.
p314_232|The next one comes up.
p314_233|This fact is supported by audience research.
p314_234|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p314_235|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
p314_236|Both sides have to step back.
p314_237|This is wonderful news.
p314_238|Is he going to look after them?
p314_239|But if they were there, they were keeping a low profile.
p314_240|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p314_241|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
p314_242|We are ready for the long haul.
p314_243|I was just getting over the time difference.
p314_244|I don't have any answer for them.
p314_245|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p314_246|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p314_247|The death toll included five children.
p314_248|EMI is a prime example.
p314_249|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p314_250|And what is she escaping from?
p314_251|You cannot allow it to go on.
p314_252|A Scottish film studio is also being considered.
p314_253|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p314_254|A friendship that will endure.
p314_255|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p314_256|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p314_257|That will not change.
p314_258|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p314_259|I thought that all musicians were the same.
p314_260|I am deeply sorry they did.
p314_261|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p314_262|Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
p314_263|Who would have thought it?
p314_264|He is young but not too young.
p314_265|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p314_266|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p314_267|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p314_268|I took a minibus into town.
p314_269|They've been at it for five hours.
p314_270|I'm not talking about his career.
p314_271|I watched a game.
p314_272|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p314_273|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p314_274|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p314_275|He has lost confidence and weight.
p314_276|Intensive care has been very busy.
p314_277|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p314_278|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p314_279|It could be a danger.
p314_280|This is my home town.
p314_281|His English counterpart agreed.
p314_282|We will build upon the basic state pension.
p314_283|Nothing can bring back their son.
p314_284|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p314_285|It's part of the game, isn't it?
p314_286|Some may end up in hospital.
p314_287|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
p314_288|The alliance said it may not wait.
p314_289|I'm not putting myself down.
p314_290|That is highly unfair.
p314_291|There is great demand for human cloning.
p314_292|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
p314_293|I am just trying to do my job.
p314_294|I don't think we could have expected better.
p314_295|You take a risk.
p314_296|What are you going to do exactly?
p314_297|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p314_298|Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
p314_299|I just want to change my life.
p314_300|A statement is expected in April.
p314_301|Check that he is dead.
p314_302|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
p314_303|He is also a great finisher.
p314_304|This club have been fair to me.
p314_305|He knew it would cost him millions.
p314_306|This is too much like Scotland.
p314_307|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p314_308|A counter reaction was.
p314_309|He said he was sorry.
p314_310|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p314_311|Clearly, she says, we would never resort to such devices.
p314_312|That only came out during a radio interview.
p314_313|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p314_314|We are waiting for them to calm down.
p314_315|We are now setting about finding them.
p314_316|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p314_317|Neither was involved in violence.
p314_318|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p314_319|Lucky for us, he enjoyed the experience.
p314_320|I am not among its admirers.
p314_321|Hitches can be expected.
p314_322|He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
p314_323|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p314_324|I'll tell you honestly.
p314_325|Dialogue is the key.
p314_326|He will address the nation this evening.
p314_327|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p314_328|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p314_329|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p314_330|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p314_331|You have to think not.
p314_332|No, no, it's not what you think.
p314_333|This is a national crisis.
p314_334|Scotland were beaten again.
p314_335|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p314_336|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p314_337|The whole thing would be perfect.
p314_338|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p314_339|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p314_340|However, we had no failures on our side.
p314_341|She had been sexually assaulted.
p314_342|His job was not advertised.
p314_343|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
p314_344|It is a thing of beauty to watch.
p314_345|With us, we just want them to respond.
p314_346|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p314_347|They are the heroes.
p314_348|For me, it was a shattering experience.
p314_349|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p314_350|This seems like a very good idea.
p314_351|It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.
p314_352|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p314_353|It took more than two years.
p314_354|There is access for disabled people.
p314_355|The home was now under new management.
p314_356|We don't want to push him.
p314_357|I like what has happened!
p314_358|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p314_359|One was a lawyer.
p314_360|There is no openness.
p314_361|We are still going ahead with our plans.
p314_362|It's being very carefully looked at.
p314_363|It was a job he loved.
p314_364|Now it has become a big picture.
p314_365|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p314_366|But let's not get carried away.
p314_367|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p314_368|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p314_369|It looks like paradise.
p314_370|This means a great deal to the families.
p314_371|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
p314_372|We were short of athletes.
p314_373|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p314_374|The European is a piece of vanity publishing.
p314_375|We want to keep the pound.
p314_376|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p314_377|Only local people are helping.
p314_378|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p314_379|There were three boys and two girls.
p314_380|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p314_381|He had no answer.
p314_382|There is a job to be done.
p314_383|Scotland is too small a country for that.
p314_384|I am not obsessed with sex.
p314_385|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p314_386|I can't believe what has happened.
p314_387|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p314_388|You do that because you want to win.
p314_389|At this level, you have all to perform well.
p314_390|It was early morning.
p314_391|Partition is not an option.
p314_392|We've been treated with complete contempt.
p314_393|There must be boundaries.
p314_394|I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
p314_395|The home team had an amazing start.
p314_396|We can make changes.
p314_397|It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.
p314_398|The conclusion is enthralling.
p314_399|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
p314_400|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p314_401|The best option is to destroy the plants.
p314_402|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p314_403|Friends of the family have given their support.
p316_001|Please call Stella.
p316_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p316_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p316_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p316_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p316_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p316_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p316_008|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p316_009|There is , according to a legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p316_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p316_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p316_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p316_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p316_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p316_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p316_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p316_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p316_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p316_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but the refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p316_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p316_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase.
p316_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p316_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p316_025|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p316_026|Meetings will also remain private.
p316_027|Have we tried everything?
p316_028|It's not going to work out that way.
p316_029|We have worked hard.
p316_030|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
p316_031|Naturally, she said yes.
p316_032|This is not a war on terror.
p316_033|It is not for any other purpose.
p316_034|There will always be problems on the way.
p316_035|Why you did it will never be known.
p316_036|He was in his element.
p316_037|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p316_038|What a week he has had.
p316_039|We just want this season to end.
p316_040|He is looking for a sporting challenge.
p316_041|There is a new confidence about the club.
p316_042|I accept that, but is very upsetting.
p316_043|We accept the challenge.
p316_044|The question is, Will it be enough?
p316_045|After that it is up to the boss.
p316_046|They were taken to prove a point.
p316_047|It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
p316_048|And they removed a Borderer.
p316_049|So, why does he do it?
p316_050|I would love to have him home.
p316_051|It is very unfair, and something should be done.
p316_052|He had no enemies.
p316_053|That is not the case this time.
p316_054|We are going to New Broomfield to win.
p316_055|But the law is very clear on this.
p316_056|They treated me with respect and courtesy.
p316_057|There was only silence.
p316_058|However, he said it would be likely to bring a chill.
p316_059|It doesn't look as pretty.
p316_060|However, our players will fight for that.
p316_061|Everyone was very saddened.
p316_062|He declined to give further details.
p316_063|He said it was for sale.
p316_064|This is a dream come true.
p316_065|The problem is not confined to the UK.
p316_066|I wouldn't give them a grade.
p316_067|What on earth is wrong with you?
p316_068|This is far too high.
p316_069|We are still going ahead with our plans.
p316_070|IS Tony Blair on drugs?
p316_071|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p316_072|It has certainly paid off for him.
p316_073|He was also a great man.
p316_074|We have a major concern about the enforcement action.
p316_075|It is clear that change is required.
p316_076|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
p316_077|This is a big step up.
p316_078|Robin Williams is subdued.
p316_079|The judge was very nice.
p316_080|They control the prices paid to farmers.
p316_081|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p316_082|Most of them have already gone home.
p316_083|Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
p316_084|Weaknesses there are, however.
p316_085|It is, after all, a very funny play.
p316_086|Can you imagine a world without design?
p316_087|He was caught and fired.
p316_088|I feel confident about the outcome.
p316_089|The driver escaped injury.
p316_090|Mini rugby is a great thing.
p316_091|There was no bad behaviour.
p316_092|Today she has been released.
p316_093|It's a much bigger problem.
p316_094|There are no problems between us at all.
p316_095|Hopefully, he will be back in contention next week.
p316_096|I've had it for the exams.
p316_097|I hope it comes out all right.
p316_098|I will just have to be patient.
p316_099|It's a sensible management decision.
p316_100|I kept it very simple.
p316_101|The rest was badminton.
p316_102|It will take several days.
p316_103|We had to push to get a goal.
p316_104|That got me out.
p316_105|I would just like someone to confess.
p316_106|We are making progress on waiting lists.
p316_107|It will have to ratify the deal.
p316_108|I did not have faith in the procedures.
p316_109|I was not a joiner.
p316_110|It has to find out what went wrong.
p316_111|Until you hit the big games.
p316_112|It has until Saturday.
p316_113|I've tried to get on with my life.
p316_114|She has the biggest part.
p316_115|We will win this tie.
p316_116|This is totally untrue.
p316_117|Or someone wants to say something different.
p316_118|I think they have to change that.
p316_119|This series is for real.
p316_120|It's great news, isn't it.
p316_121|It's very ingenious.
p316_122|That would depend on the parole board.
p316_123|It is all up to the Members.
p316_124|The two sets are different.
p316_125|And now the pressure is off.
p316_126|You can see the appeal of running away.
p316_127|Their opening was disastrous.
p316_128|The time is up for Iraq to comply.
p316_129|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p316_130|The following are the principal provisions.
p316_131|Too much has already been said.
p316_132|Now, however, things are different.
p316_133|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
p316_134|She is not the world champion.
p316_135|It would be difficult to argue with that.
p316_136|While they went on a holiday, we got the contract.
p316_137|He is a bully.
p316_138|The case was taken on by his brother.
p316_139|I've won the British.
p316_140|And so the cycle continues.
p316_141|I don't have many friends.
p316_142|However, it was a different story in the final.
p316_143|They exist in name alone.
p316_144|I am not retiring.
p316_145|All will be revealed in due course.
p316_146|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p316_147|And frankly, it's been a while.
p316_148|Feel for five seconds.
p316_149|I hope it is a good omen.
p316_150|Because if it matters to them, it matters to me.
p316_151|They will appear again next week.
p316_152|Failure is not an option.
p316_153|We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
p316_154|You look at that.
p316_155|Things begin to spring to life.
p316_156|Or was it Some kind of a ham?
p316_157|I understood that concern.
p316_158|The things writers and directors say!
p316_159|I am prepared to step down.
p316_160|It was like a dream to be here.
p316_161|The four characters could be one somebody suggested.
p316_162|Either way, it doesn't bother me.
p316_163|It would help to heal the wounds.
p316_164|We did not deserve to go through.
p316_165|It's got to be in the head.
p316_166|It certainly sounded it at times.
p316_167|It will be too hot.
p316_168|That happens in boxing.
p316_169|Consumers will also benefit.
p316_170|None of the opinions is good.
p316_171|We were hopeful that it would be successful.
p316_172|They must not succeed.
p316_173|He declined to provide a breakdown.
p316_174|But the foundations have been laid.
p316_175|I have never seen him like that.
p316_176|And you need to be so resourceful.
p316_177|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarerry.
p316_178|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p316_179|Everything in the world was focused on London.
p316_180|We played better after the break.
p316_181|But this relative success has not been easy.
p316_182|It was the same with the Dickens.
p316_183|Of course it is still possible.
p316_184|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
p316_185|That, in a way, is the point.
p316_186|What is so unusual about this case?
p316_187|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
p316_188|That would end it for us.
p316_189|Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.
p316_190|Sure, he is the best player in the world.
p316_191|I just love lessons.
p316_192|Retirement is on his mind.
p316_193|It's to do with this place.
p316_194|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p316_195|We shall not be moved.
p316_196|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p316_197|It is not just the agencies.
p316_198|There must be boundaries.
p316_199|However, he was later released without charge.
p316_200|Arsenal refused to be evicted.
p316_201|I watch the other visitors.
p316_202|Nobody is pushing out to the right.
p316_204|He confirmed his fitness.
p316_205|The gap is narrowing.
p316_206|All of us in Scotland should be viligant.
p316_207|Both men were uninjured.
p316_208|My husband was fighting for his life.
p316_209|It is not a financial issue.
p316_210|We are in this for the long haul.
p316_211|We have a budget in March.
p316_212|There was no respite.
p316_213|I got very, very tired.
p316_214|I am really sorry that he is going.
p316_215|They will do their own thing.
p316_216|It is too much for me.
p316_217|But is this enough to provoke a killing?
p316_218|I didn't just walk in and get it.
p316_219|We've made a couple of albums.
p316_220|We need a much wider debate.
p316_221|My attitude is exactly the same as before.
p316_222|Look at a computer.
p316_223|They went back to the seventeenth.
p316_224|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p316_225|So what could be better than becoming a captain?
p316_226|However, it proved to be the turning point.
p316_227|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
p316_228|In hindsight, it was the wrong decision.
p316_229|I waited and waited.
p316_230|We all knew it could not be true.
p316_231|Its future is uncertain.
p316_232|I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
p316_233|It doesn't look good for her.
p316_234|She said he did not look too happy.
p316_235|We are aware of the problem.
p316_236|Where will the elderly go then?
p316_237|Then it was changed without notice.
p316_238|He had a great game.
p316_239|The following year, they asked him again.
p316_240|It is the men who create the demand.
p316_241|I'm very happy indeed to be almost redundant.
p316_242|Every case is completely different.
p316_243|It's a scandal, a disgrace.
p316_244|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
p316_245|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p316_246|It will be fine.
p316_247|He should emerge as the winner.
p316_248|They are you, the fans.
p316_249|We're just waiting for her reaction.
p316_250|At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
p316_251|What a difference a game can make.
p316_252|They will not be able to come back, in my opinion.
p316_253|Why do it?
p316_254|It opened last month.
p316_255|This will be our new beginning.
p316_256|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
p316_257|I have totally had enough.
p316_258|Hopefully today will be the turning point.
p316_259|We shall be ready for Rangers.
p316_260|It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
p316_261|There were no reported casualties on the ground.
p316_262|What are you waiting for?
p316_263|In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
p316_264|This is still happening in the US.
p316_265|Another issue will be policing.
p316_266|Today was first class.
p316_267|This is the biggest surprise of my life.
p316_268|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p316_269|This is a good move for me.
p316_270|Feel the heat?
p316_271|She was so full of life.
p316_272|I should have given him one in return.
p316_273|I began to pray.
p316_274|The princess has strong links with Scotland.
p316_275|I am very confident about tomorrow night.
p316_276|I just wanted to fly.
p316_277|And he has a tale to tell.
p316_278|Footballers have also been targeted.
p316_279|The deadline is real and absolute.
p316_280|So, how did this happen?
p316_281|It's all a part of letting it go.
p316_282|I just hope it's not tonight against us.
p316_283|There are no quick fixes.
p316_284|The change was not instant.
p316_285|We've got the bronze.
p316_286|They use them for everything.
p316_287|Who is to benefit from this change?
p316_288|We are not defeated.
p316_289|He knows what he's got to do.
p316_290|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p316_291|We have been going for three years.
p316_292|We deserved the three points.
p316_293|It is planned for London in the spring.
p316_294|War and force are not the only solutions.
p316_295|They would have to go to the Royal.
p316_296|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p316_297|Which brings us to the point.
p316_298|I think it's difficult for Bonnie.
p316_299|I am quite excited about it.
p316_300|Everyone agrees with that.
p316_301|She had denied the charge.
p316_302|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p316_303|Sometimes you stand on them as they collapse.
p316_304|I didn't feel good.
p316_305|It is believed that he had been stabbed.
p316_306|It is an expensive part of their equipment.
p316_307|Let's get to know him.
p316_308|We have got to attack.
p316_309|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p316_310|Time has run out for Saddam Hussein.
p316_311|It divided audiences at Cannes.
p316_312|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p316_313|How would it work?
p316_314|We told them in July.
p316_315|The film was great.
p316_316|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p316_317|It's a real challenge.
p316_318|The police believe that the man was not injured.
p316_319|Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
p316_320|There was too much at stake.
p316_321|I read about it in the newspapers.
p316_322|What did they think of her voice?
p316_323|Is that not uncanny?
p316_324|It has to reinvent itself.
p316_325|It is a good result for Great Britain.
p316_326|He was happy with his form.
p316_327|His art was not just about emotions.
p316_328|Nato was not a love affair.
p316_329|It's a production company.
p316_330|But we will not be scared.
p316_331|But that is not an issue for now.
p316_332|It will not work in our favour.
p316_333|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
p316_334|He is on the wrong side.
p316_335|That was a disgraceful performance.
p316_336|There will be no receivers.
p316_337|My son was too young to die.
p316_338|The air campaign is not over yet.
p316_339|It's a national sport.
p316_340|But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
p316_341|The picture in Glasgow was improving, he added.
p316_342|Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
p316_343|I was shocked and outraged.
p316_344|Not many people like to do that.
p316_345|It was extremely cold.
p316_346|Italy would be lukewarm.
p316_347|People are using it in their daily lives.
p316_348|Chelsea was a great club.
p316_349|We have to open up.
p316_350|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p316_351|There is a review outgoing at the moment.
p316_352|The pensioners did not want to know.
p316_353|It was just awful.
p316_354|We are doing okay in the league.
p316_355|Today the Kremlin would be contacted in seconds.
p316_356|It is time for concerted national action.
p316_357|Do you know who we are?
p316_358|Souter will be back.
p316_359|I'd like to report a murder.
p316_360|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p316_361|It certainly gives you hope.
p316_362|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
p316_363|Two people have died.
p316_364|Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
p316_365|I am delighted to have her back home.
p316_366|Many of them were his friends and colleagues.
p316_367|It is based on his movement records.
p316_368|It wasn't an easy decision.
p316_369|It left me with sadness.
p316_370|There is a changing of the guard.
p316_371|The boys are very confident.
p316_372|It was our time maybe.
p316_373|I know we can play a lot better.
p316_374|We said it will happen one night.
p316_375|It is a flexible concept.
p316_376|This election is far from over.
p316_377|So the Government will be damaged.
p316_378|Ali was shot at, but refused to back down.
p316_379|However, we let them back into the game.
p316_380|I have great confidence in Annabelle.
p316_381|Is that such a bad thing?
p316_382|You do need a check and a balance.
p316_383|Thousands of people were missing.
p316_384|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p316_385|It's time to move on.
p316_386|I couldn't get out of bed.
p316_387|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p316_388|I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.
p316_389|I can't describe it.
p316_390|It changed my life.
p316_391|But what will we put on it?
p316_392|It will benefit a lot of people.
p316_393|A new school will be built.
p316_394|There may be hope this year, however.
p316_395|That is not too bad.
p316_396|They are taking a stand against this.
p316_397|They are not left wing.
p316_398|I was the sheep.
p316_399|I think we believed the tie was won.
p316_400|Well, there you go.
p316_401|How do you find the youngsters?
p316_402|It was a great team effort.
p316_403|In my experience, he does not do that.
p317_001|Please call Stella.
p317_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p317_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p317_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p317_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p317_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p317_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p317_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p317_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p317_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p317_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p317_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p317_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p317_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p317_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p317_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p317_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p317_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p317_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p317_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p317_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p317_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p317_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p317_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p317_025|They have the cash to do that.
p317_026|There was a fine line to tread.
p317_027|Yet it is all for two good causes.
p317_028|It is so elusive and light.
p317_029|I am not a fan of stoppages.
p317_030|The council has been open and transparent.
p317_031|Is the war over?
p317_032|The country is in a state of chaos.
p317_033|But don't expect an easy ride.
p317_034|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p317_035|Some US embassy staff have left the country.
p317_036|It was a policy they were against.
p317_037|Her mother said she fell off a swing.
p317_038|We see little sign of improvement.
p317_039|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
p317_040|The gaffer was great.
p317_041|Overall, however, these were also down.
p317_042|Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
p317_043|Had she enjoyed the experience?
p317_044|I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
p317_045|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p317_046|I would think they are just behind them.
p317_047|We then went to see the headmaster.
p317_048|As far as we are concerned, he is innocent anyway.
p317_049|There is no mandate for a regime change.
p317_050|He did the right thing by ignoring me.
p317_051|These men are a part of India.
p317_052|Are we going to stay up?
p317_053|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p317_054|I am going home to see my children.
p317_055|New potential dangers were emerging.
p317_056|That tells you something about them.
p317_057|The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
p317_058|I am a drug addict.
p317_059|I've had to take time off work today.
p317_060|The problem is the book.
p317_061|There was no basis for their arrest.
p317_062|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p317_063|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
p317_064|They say he wants to go to England.
p317_065|They are the partner of choice for anyone.
p317_066|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
p317_067|Wagner was never like this.
p317_068|It is an attitude of mind.
p317_069|How do you resurrect a dying town?
p317_070|And what does it cost, and who is paying?
p317_071|I've come here for the jersey.
p317_072|This is not an optional extra.
p317_073|This is not the most crucial issue.
p317_074|We don't know much, but we are still awaiting news.
p317_075|It's that sort of night.
p317_076|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
p317_077|Will we ever play together again?
p317_078|It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
p317_079|I played well but missed a few chances.
p317_080|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p317_081|I'm so proud of my team.
p317_082|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p317_083|That would open the gates of hell.
p317_084|This has not, and has been neglected.
p317_085|McNaughton was not so sure.
p317_086|What did you learn in school today?
p317_087|If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
p317_088|We will see how he is after treatment.
p317_089|This is rapidly becoming a fiasco.
p317_090|There is no signature on this document.
p317_091|We could not compete with Rangers.
p317_092|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p317_093|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
p317_094|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p317_095|However, it is much bigger than that.
p317_096|One season, they might do well.
p317_097|Our approach will be different.
p317_098|Too much has already been said.
p317_099|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p317_100|But don't worry just yet.
p317_101|This championship is different from the other majors.
p317_102|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
p317_103|I drove the ball well.
p317_104|If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
p317_105|His handling raises a wider issue.
p317_106|We have got the school holidays on.
p317_107|This is not a recipe for conflict.
p317_108|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p317_109|We understand the changes in the world.
p317_110|It is a potential factor.
p317_111|This is the big one.
p317_112|That just wasn't good enough.
p317_113|The company has other problems with the shells.
p317_114|The working families tax credit is far better.
p317_115|He had done his homework properly.
p317_116|Then, as we know too well, anything can happen.
p317_117|We must get the three points.
p317_118|Players were held in equally low regard.
p317_119|I was in the train station overnight.
p317_120|It's to do with context.
p317_121|Now we need to keep our heads up.
p317_122|Our home is your home.
p317_123|It is essential that we win the game.
p317_124|There was no confusion over the second.
p317_125|Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
p317_126|A decision is expected shortly.
p317_127|Hear what they have to say.
p317_128|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
p317_129|You would be wrong.
p317_130|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p317_131|Mr Wilson had two brothers and three sisters.
p317_132|I think it is wide open.
p317_133|They too refused to come out and talk.
p317_134|We took the chances when they came.
p317_135|It is important that vital services are maintained.
p317_136|These services may also have to be cut.
p317_137|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
p317_138|The captaincy will help that, too.
p317_139|We can't have it both ways.
p317_140|Actors stand still in the frame.
p317_141|Who honestly expected anything else?
p317_142|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
p317_143|MOVIE stars are public property.
p317_144|They never looked like winning it either.
p317_145|A Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment.
p317_146|No details of the talks were given.
p317_147|The group is separate from the Real IRA.
p317_148|It was a wilful act of violence.
p317_149|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p317_150|We never got off the bus.
p317_151|The driver escaped injury.
p317_152|T, Is there anything in the wound?
p317_153|They should be looking at his victims.
p317_154|We told them in June.
p317_155|It's all about money, money, money.
p317_156|I won't make an official complaint.
p317_157|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p317_158|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p317_159|She is a double victim.
p317_160|How can you not react?
p317_161|They make a selective perception process.
p317_162|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p317_163|I am totally devoted to this job.
p317_164|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p317_165|There was an e-mail.
p317_166|That is a lot of writing.
p317_167|I try to be open to experience.
p317_168|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p317_169|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p317_170|It is no place for a poet.
p317_171|This is excellent value for money.
p317_172|Each day is a new beginning.
p317_173|My daughter is an adult.
p317_174|It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
p317_175|They are difficult awards to decide.
p317_176|Thereafter he left Scotland.
p317_177|We've come from a long way back.
p317_178|A lot of things can go wrong.
p317_179|I was delighted with Robbie.
p317_180|He seemed to lose his focus.
p317_181|I'll just do my best.
p317_182|Three penalties were given.
p317_183|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p317_184|The police were called in.
p317_185|The group would never be the same again.
p317_186|Aye, but who do you really support?
p317_187|She was eight months pregnant at the time.
p317_188|This is not a birthday party.
p317_189|This makes no sense!
p317_190|It's a drop in the bucket.
p317_191|I've had a hard time, to be honest.
p317_192|He said that this is beautiful.
p317_193|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p317_194|That option cannot be ruled out.
p317_195|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p317_196|Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
p317_197|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p317_198|Three years probation is just a joke.
p317_199|That's how she wants to remember him.
p317_200|How do you respond to losing your child?
p317_201|Who is the employer?
p317_202|This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?
p317_203|Mr Smith was dismissive.
p317_204|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
p317_205|Pressure of work is no excuse.
p317_206|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
p317_207|Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
p317_208|Would he be able to live with that?
p317_209|However, what is his calibre?
p317_210|I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
p317_211|Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
p317_212|It's a production company.
p317_213|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
p317_214|She died in middle age.
p317_215|They do the work, you know.
p317_216|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p317_217|We are in the hat.
p317_218|We were a load of rubbish.
p317_219|Thus far we have received no complaints.
p317_220|I haven't made the donation yet.
p317_221|Other people also tried.
p317_222|But Harry has become a franchise.
p317_223|He is at war with his knee.
p317_224|I could go on, but none of these things is true.
p317_225|I can't deny that fact.
p317_226|Clubs can only do so much.
p317_227|It's unsafe for society.
p317_228|Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
p317_229|It would have very little impact on them.
p317_230|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p317_231|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
p317_232|I will be having talks with the workforce.
p317_233|I don't care to recall it.
p317_234|That's the whole idea.
p317_235|They showed a lot of heart.
p317_236|Michael, he is running!
p317_237|My life is a mess.
p317_238|He did not report it.
p317_239|You must be ready to play anyone.
p317_240|For example they could be in school uniform.
p317_241|Surely the panel was interested?
p317_242|They were even being used by primary pupils.
p317_243|It's like English in its underwear.
p317_244|This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
p317_245|I now know that from memory.
p317_246|We need to tighten up.
p317_247|I saw it at a ruck.
p317_248|This is a huge event.
p317_249|Just get on with your job.
p317_250|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p317_251|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p317_252|You are not going in blind.
p317_253|They just made me feel dizzy.
p317_254|He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
p317_255|He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
p317_256|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p317_257|Health care workers and labourers followed.
p317_258|Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
p317_259|We have great confidence in Derek.
p317_260|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
p317_261|We are not too surprised.
p317_262|There were no new cases yesterday.
p317_263|If only the problems concerned the players.
p317_264|It will be an eye for an eye.
p317_265|Whatever happened to that one?
p317_266|There were no proposals on the table.
p317_267|I have spoken to head office.
p317_268|Here the National Gallery has been very clever.
p317_269|Do you want a cup of tea.
p317_270|Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
p317_271|We have all been shocked by her death.
p317_272|We are asking the council to think again.
p317_273|We are committed to urgent action.
p317_274|Hopefully, now we're getting it.
p317_275|I am totally surprised.
p317_276|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
p317_277|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
p317_278|The bookies have got it about right.
p317_279|There's not much money in cycling.
p317_280|It was always open for extension.
p317_281|I think we're very different.
p317_282|For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
p317_283|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p317_284|And that is not a bad idea.
p317_285|He also has a house in Italy.
p317_286|Blood samples were taken.
p317_287|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p317_288|Scotland need to work on two key areas.
p317_289|It's so creative and different.
p317_290|They are in care for a reason.
p317_291|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
p317_292|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
p317_293|Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
p317_294|It got no better.
p317_295|I keep my fingers crossed.
p317_296|Some were close to tears.
p317_297|It would then be up to the judge.
p317_298|Was all this really just five months ago?
p317_299|Some reports said they had been killed.
p317_300|This is the start of a new campaign.
p317_301|It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
p317_302|The failings are serious.
p317_303|It is like a bereavement.
p317_304|I shouldn't have to put up with it.
p317_305|It could have been just a quick fix.
p317_306|I got on very well with Allan.
p317_307|That has given me great confidence.
p317_308|This is a dream come true for me.
p317_309|No other country has ever won this tournament.
p317_310|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
p317_311|He was lying face down in the water.
p317_312|He confirmed there had been no warning.
p317_313|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p317_314|Managers and clinicians must work together.
p317_315|They didn't have a care in the world.
p317_316|I was in the zone in the morning.
p317_317|He urged people to forgive.
p317_318|In fact, it might just be beginning.
p317_319|So he is open to ideas.
p317_320|Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
p317_321|Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
p317_322|There is no right to appeal.
p317_323|We are expected to do better than before.
p317_324|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p317_325|I am not even thinking about that.
p317_326|Scotland is one of the favourites, with Glasgow to the fore.
p317_327|The World Trade Centre was our Main Street.
p317_328|It is good for their eyesight.
p317_329|I feel it is very irrational.
p317_330|It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
p317_331|It is still with Ministers.
p317_332|The effect was almost magical.
p317_333|Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
p317_334|We are not doing the Today programme.
p317_335|It's not that difficult, it really isn't.
p317_336|She was charged with perjury.
p317_337|I was not a joiner.
p317_338|The sleeper was six hours late.
p317_339|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p317_340|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p317_341|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p317_342|They were average apart, together superb.
p317_343|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p317_344|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p317_345|That never seemed likely.
p317_346|A decision is expected next March.
p317_347|We don't believe anything anymore.
p317_348|I am awaiting a reply.
p317_349|There was no need for such a hostel.
p317_350|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p317_351|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
p317_352|There's no doubt about it.
p317_353|It just came into my head that day.
p317_354|We've always had a very positive attitude.
p317_355|What's a boy to do?
p317_356|We're not an employment agency.
p317_357|The other was the tabloids.
p317_358|They should be swept away.
p317_359|They thought the set-up there was unfair.
p317_360|I am saddened to hear of the accident.
p317_361|We want to replicate that success.
p317_362|We were lucky to have survived.
p317_363|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p317_364|I am very happy to be here.
p317_365|He would help me with the form.
p317_366|We could easily be cut again.
p317_367|That meant the search was unlawful.
p317_368|And he goes with it.
p317_369|The actors just have to say so.
p317_370|Someone else can do the cooking that night.
p317_371|I am so lucky for that.
p317_372|It broke up my marriage.
p317_373|He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
p317_374|The minister is the engineer.
p317_375|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
p317_376|I think it was briefly considered.
p317_377|And Rangers think they have problems.
p317_378|We talk to each other about these matters.
p317_379|It's a hidden problem.
p317_380|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p317_381|There will be two other areas of contention.
p317_382|I lost a part of me.
p317_383|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p317_384|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
p317_385|But he has strong links to Labour.
p317_386|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p317_387|I never thought it would take this long.
p317_388|And he is immensely loyal.
p317_389|It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
p317_390|They think that it matters but it doesn't.
p317_391|This looks like it is anything but open.
p317_392|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
p317_393|She kept him on a string.
p317_394|The committees are due to report next year.
p317_395|It's a long-term solution.
p317_396|That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
p317_397|What's the theme?
p317_398|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
p317_399|It shows that painting is still relevant.
p317_400|It's a very special unit.
p317_401|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p317_402|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p317_403|However, the groups denied the claims.
p317_404|It's only tackling congestion.
p318_001|Please call Stella.
p318_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p318_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we can go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p318_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p318_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p318_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p318_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p318_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p318_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p318_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p318_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p318_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p318_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p318_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p318_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p318_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p318_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p318_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p318_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p318_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p318_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p318_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p318_025|They will be dealt with.
p318_026|It is never an easy game.
p318_027|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p318_028|I intend to raise the matter there.
p318_029|However, it's good to turn the page.
p318_030|We have to put this behind us.
p318_031|I thought it was quite good.
p318_032|It was important to win the singles.
p318_033|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p318_034|That is impressive by any standards.
p318_035|We are doing very well as we are.
p318_036|The waiting is over, well almost.
p318_037|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
p318_038|I'm not allowed to say that, of course.
p318_039|It helped to get me noticed.
p318_040|They hit me in the head.
p318_041|But he is not using them.
p318_042|That, though, was just the start of it.
p318_043|We are not moving in.
p318_044|We have not had a formal request.
p318_045|I never had a childhood.
p318_046|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p318_047|We offered something different.
p318_048|We were very much a happy family.
p318_049|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p318_050|My brother is buried under there.
p318_051|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p318_052|What were they?
p318_053|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p318_054|He will be judged by his actions.
p318_055|Her role in it was small.
p318_056|I have really noticed that this week.
p318_057|We might be back next year.
p318_058|In a way he was.
p318_059|It's back to how it used to be.
p318_060|It is not a standing army.
p318_061|The firm was down and almost out.
p318_062|They said they were only young men.
p318_063|I was chosen to do this.
p318_064|I learned a lot from that.
p318_065|The house was so well alight.
p318_066|He got his degree.
p318_067|Sandy was very active.
p318_068|However, there is great potential in this right.
p318_069|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p318_070|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p318_071|There were no formal announcements.
p318_072|Before the games it was pretty open.
p318_073|It really has left the town in shock.
p318_074|But you can go beyond that condition.
p318_075|I'm so worried about the roads.
p318_076|This was much worse.
p318_077|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p318_078|We are confident of taking that back.
p318_079|They must be kept on the ground.
p318_080|Did they give any good advice?
p318_081|Who wants to be a millionaire?
p318_082|This does not help.
p318_083|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p318_084|That's why the ministers resigned.
p318_085|He has lost confidence and weight.
p318_086|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p318_087|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p318_088|This could be her way forward.
p318_089|This gives us a lot of practice.
p318_090|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p318_091|It's a very, very special day.
p318_092|The crucial strike was yet to come.
p318_093|There's also the point.
p318_094|It was forced to divert.
p318_095|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p318_096|That's the National Grid.
p318_097|But Allen is deadly serious.
p318_098|Peter doesn't want to leave.
p318_099|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p318_100|They have just got to believe in themselves.
p318_101|This is my personal assessment.
p318_102|There was no trouble at all.
p318_103|Although, you never know.
p318_104|We shall be victorious.
p318_105|The quality of work is very impressive.
p318_106|However, he added there were signs of progress.
p318_107|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p318_108|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p318_109|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p318_110|I took the gun.
p318_111|It's just one of those things.
p318_112|A web site is planned for November.
p318_113|We played so well at times.
p318_114|I was very fortunate.
p318_115|Such a policy would be a disaster.
p318_116|We act because we must.
p318_117|They will be destroyed.
p318_118|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p318_119|O Neill is reputed to have replied.
p318_120|The Tory party will last.
p318_121|It was a journey into a new life.
p318_122|It's a way of making a mark.
p318_123|There is a great carry over value.
p318_124|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p318_125|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p318_126|What's the point?
p318_127|Why is this?
p318_128|What has changed since then?
p318_129|Raymond was always on the outside.
p318_130|We need to make more inquiries about that.
p318_131|I'd love to be at the World Cup.
p318_132|He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
p318_133|I am sorry to hear this news.
p318_134|At some point, the bill will be presented.
p318_135|I mean it happens.
p318_136|This week is a perfect example.
p318_137|This performance has given my confidence a boost.
p318_138|Receiving this medal is an honour.
p318_139|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p318_140|But every two minutes it was exploding.
p318_141|That sort of thing is long gone.
p318_142|It is typical of me.
p318_143|However, consumers may take a different view.
p318_144|They played it like a cup final.
p318_145|However, it is not all bad news for women.
p318_146|But the championship is not over yet.
p318_147|We haven't found out anything different.
p318_148|A review of the decision is being sought.
p318_149|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
p318_150|Still, in the end, it was a fair result.
p318_151|Surely it can do better than that?
p318_152|I am ashamed of them.
p318_153|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
p318_154|The salary changes are long overdue.
p318_155|I, like an idiot, agreed.
p318_156|If so, we want to hear from them.
p318_157|I am not blaming audiences.
p318_158|Who was on the panel?
p318_159|They may differ on other issues.
p318_160|He had never run the distance before.
p318_161|I can make one further announcement.
p318_162|The General Election is all to play for.
p318_163|It was a fiery game.
p318_164|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p318_165|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p318_166|Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.
p318_167|It will not be easy for him.
p318_168|This one is a special case.
p318_169|But what are the songs about?
p318_170|There is a simmering anger out there.
p318_171|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p318_172|That is not a position they enjoy.
p318_173|The stadium was full.
p318_174|Dewar is the medium.
p318_175|It was that kind of night.
p318_176|It is very much a matter for them.
p318_177|Perhaps it is jealousy.
p318_178|Any error is severely punished.
p318_179|He's got a great chance of making it.
p318_180|We won't do that.
p318_181|I hope we do.
p318_182|From now on there is no hiding place.
p318_183|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p318_184|He quit in October.
p318_185|The United Nations must act.
p318_186|Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
p318_187|Her daughter is getting married.
p318_188|His manager blamed the referee.
p318_189|They were that poor.
p318_190|Patients will be partners in decision making.
p318_191|We have understood the problems for some time.
p318_192|Stan is a vital part of our future.
p318_193|All these things have an impact.
p318_194|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p318_195|They believed it worked.
p318_196|After that, though, we are still waiting to see.
p318_197|They should feel ashamed.
p318_198|This is a really serious issue.
p318_199|So they will settle again.
p318_200|How do we get more people in?
p318_201|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p318_202|It looks as though there is no chance.
p318_203|This is not a European Army.
p318_204|Election results are expected soon.
p318_205|So she told him.
p318_206|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p318_207|There are moments of honesty, too.
p318_208|It was good to score the goal today.
p318_209|The night is young.
p318_210|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
p318_211|I suspect that it will.
p318_212|But there's no eye contact.
p318_213|The squad will be the same for France.
p318_214|We are a party for people, not against people.
p318_215|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p318_216|We are still paying the price for that.
p318_217|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
p318_218|It is not a wish list.
p318_219|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
p318_220|Some of the players have not progressed.
p318_221|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
p318_222|If not, he should go home.
p318_223|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
p318_224|There is no margin for error.
p318_225|This was not an easy meeting for me.
p318_226|From our point of view, it is the right time.
p318_227|That figure will always remain with me.
p318_228|And then a funny thing happened.
p318_229|It does not take much.
p318_230|She asked us a lot of questions.
p318_231|It was a stunning strike.
p318_232|It is a technique.
p318_233|They hold on for many years.
p318_234|Is it the shape of things to come?
p318_235|My body is exhausted.
p318_236|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p318_237|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
p318_238|There is nothing to fear.
p318_239|I was an athlete.
p318_240|Life was like a timetable.
p318_241|World leaders expressed their sympathy.
p318_242|I tried to push him away.
p318_243|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p318_244|This was done by the council staff.
p318_245|The truth is otherwise.
p318_246|We haven't come out of this very well.
p318_247|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p318_248|I thought they could have made the gesture.
p318_249|We should be rewarded for producing.
p318_250|The bottom line is that this must stop.
p318_251|Which, in effect, it is.
p318_252|The man became a reporter.
p318_253|It is a memorial.
p318_254|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p318_255|Our people are paying high prices.
p318_256|The reason is partly because of tradition.
p318_257|Nor is it likely to do so.
p318_258|Or so everyone believed.
p318_259|Perhaps we should do the same.
p318_260|I read it every year.
p318_261|He was in contention almost every week.
p318_262|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p318_263|It is up to Ann.
p318_264|We are playing them at their own game.
p318_265|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p318_266|I had trouble with the producers.
p318_267|So, it took me back to boarding school.
p318_268|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p318_269|The conference is the first test.
p318_270|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p318_271|I expect a rapid response.
p318_272|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p318_273|There is no more money.
p318_274|My mother is a widow.
p318_275|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p318_276|There have been different reports from different people.
p318_277|It's an absolute disgrace.
p318_278|Something was plainly wrong.
p318_279|Why should he go anywhere?
p318_280|One thing is sure.
p318_281|It was a foolhardy decision.
p318_282|I'm confident we can do that.
p318_283|Funding needs to be long term.
p318_284|It's funny how it comes and goes.
p318_285|I would never even consider it.
p318_286|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
p318_287|The end result is precisely the same.
p318_288|We have it on video.
p318_289|I am not a threat to coaches.
p318_290|Painful, but only because it's true.
p318_291|It's never over until it's over.
p318_292|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
p318_293|This year, it was a little different.
p318_294|That, though, is to miss the point.
p318_295|We gave them the goal.
p318_296|Is being naturally funny enough?
p318_297|What's the point of staying sober?
p318_298|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p318_299|The incident is being taken seriously.
p318_300|So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
p318_301|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
p318_302|I can feel the sound inside.
p318_303|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p318_304|I am not a fan of books.
p318_305|SO now we know the secret.
p318_306|It may well have been.
p318_307|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p318_308|It was a simple question.
p318_309|I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
p318_310|And we have beaten them before.
p318_311|Could you put it in writing?
p318_312|I am not a paedophile.
p318_313|Some of their movement was excellent.
p318_314|But they had to be paid for.
p318_315|The odds are that it will.
p318_316|But then they scored their fourth.
p318_317|They deserve a lot of credit.
p318_318|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p318_319|Why is that?
p318_320|Then came the crunch.
p318_321|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p318_322|But will they fall in love?
p318_323|As if they ever stopped.
p318_324|The referee had a shocking game.
p318_325|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
p318_326|For a few years we had good fun.
p318_327|Medical staff are with them at the moment.
p318_328|It went on to become an annual event.
p318_329|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p318_330|We are now in an election period.
p318_331|Everyone is too upset to comment.
p318_332|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p318_333|But when we do it is great.
p318_334|She has nothing to say to journalists.
p318_335|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p318_336|He pleaded for caution.
p318_337|I disagree entirely with the decision.
p318_338|They've been wonderful to me.
p318_339|I can't believe the buzz.
p318_340|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p318_341|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p318_342|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
p318_343|It's no less intriguing, however.
p318_344|It's a question of perception.
p318_345|Staff have been informed.
p318_346|My heart is not so sure.
p318_347|This morning was very quiet.
p318_348|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
p318_349|It has been handled entirely properly.
p318_350|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p318_351|That might help a bit.
p318_352|Two others were also seriously injured.
p318_353|He was made redundant in February last year.
p318_354|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p318_355|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p318_356|You have obviously got an answer to it.
p318_357|It seems very odd.
p318_358|Closure is not one of them.
p318_359|The hotel was huge.
p318_360|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p318_361|Well, you can have a tree.
p318_362|It was the same at Twickenham.
p318_363|This is an internal matter.
p318_364|I am amazed at what he's done.
p318_365|They took a risk.
p318_366|The idea was presented to me.
p318_367|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p318_368|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p318_369|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p318_370|The hearing was fair.
p318_371|I see it as my job.
p318_372|This was not a summit about the euro.
p318_373|Frank Warren is a great man.
p318_374|I am a little bit tired.
p318_375|That was never their agenda.
p318_376|She died at her home.
p318_377|She is currently in foster care.
p318_378|That's the only thing that matters.
p318_379|I enjoy the creative process.
p318_380|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p318_381|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p318_382|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
p318_383|It's always the same, isn't it?
p318_384|We have been preparing all year.
p318_385|We could learn a lot from them.
p318_386|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p318_387|Sure, we have problems.
p318_388|I was released after six days.
p318_389|That time is not far away.
p318_390|I may think about performing it.
p318_391|There are a number of possible outcomes.
p318_392|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p318_393|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p318_394|You can't go back and change things.
p318_395|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p318_396|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p318_397|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
p318_398|He says it often enough.
p318_399|Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.
p318_400|His primary residence is Scotland.
p318_401|I found that much more challenging.
p318_402|This fight is not going to go away.
p318_403|It would have been very easily done.
p318_404|I will never manage another Scottish club.
p323_001|Please call Stella.
p323_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p323_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p323_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p323_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p323_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p323_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p323_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p323_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p323_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p323_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p323_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p323_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p323_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p323_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p323_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p323_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p323_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p323_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p323_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p323_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p323_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p323_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p323_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p323_025|We've made a couple of albums.
p323_026|Film music was never the same again.
p323_027|It was a deeply moving musical experience.
p323_028|Now it is much easier.
p323_029|However, on the other hand, in principle it is plainly wrong.
p323_030|This is the best way to do it.
p323_031|Its role is not to interfere.
p323_032|Leisure centres were also affected.
p323_033|Something happened on that island.
p323_034|Meantime, the department is proposing structural changes.
p323_035|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p323_036|It is misleading to compare the two.
p323_037|They discussed how he might get involved.
p323_038|And this perception might find an unlikely supporter.
p323_039|And it had two seats.
p323_040|They were not up to speed.
p323_041|We know the quality of life goes up.
p323_042|What is next?
p323_043|Now they have found out the truth.
p323_044|We've still got a say in this.
p323_045|The first was excluding Sinn Fein.
p323_046|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p323_047|We have our supporters and our enemies.
p323_048|Mackie was at home, unable to watch.
p323_049|So, what's it about?
p323_050|We have been let down by these people.
p323_051|What's it for?
p323_052|Nor does he have any desire to be.
p323_053|How well did they get on?
p323_054|I don't think it is a drawback.
p323_055|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p323_056|They may have been murdered.
p323_057|However this weekend it will be different.
p323_058|We didn't try hard enough, that is all.
p323_059|It also condemned the suicide bombers.
p323_060|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p323_061|It is very difficult.
p323_062|This is the place to play football.
p323_063|But it was a great decision he joked.
p323_064|Then they killed another three.
p323_065|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
p323_066|The six others were injured.
p323_067|Most of the others were in their twenties.
p323_068|We were beaten by the better team today.
p323_069|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p323_070|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
p323_071|The law has got to be upheld.
p323_072|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p323_073|I mean they have just been a disaster.
p323_074|He's a joy to follow.
p323_075|That is my personal view.
p323_076|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
p323_077|I saw the explosion and panicked.
p323_078|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p323_079|The punishment was swift.
p323_080|Who will run the bigger show?
p323_081|General, You didn't get a modified.
p323_082|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p323_083|These things just happen.
p323_084|And, within itself, it is visionary.
p323_085|Are you up for business?
p323_086|It's an interesting debate to get going.
p323_087|Who does he think will win?
p323_088|I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
p323_089|An announcement will follow in due course.
p323_090|You are not in any kind of trouble.
p323_091|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p323_092|Will they fall out?
p323_093|Scotland came very close in the second Test.
p323_094|He was not able to talk to us.
p323_095|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p323_096|There is no conflict of interest.
p323_097|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p323_098|They are not suitable.
p323_099|It does seem a mystery.
p323_100|But he is something special, is he not?
p323_101|Club rugby refuses to die.
p323_102|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p323_103|He could look after himself, but didn't.
p323_104|The decision was designed to shock investors.
p323_105|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p323_106|We are not dealing here with refugees.
p323_107|It's up to their parents to choose.
p323_108|I've had a very long run.
p323_109|It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
p323_110|He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
p323_111|Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.
p323_112|It doesn't make them evil.
p323_113|I have played really well all year.
p323_114|We were a shambles at the back.
p323_115|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
p323_116|No passengers were on board.
p323_117|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
p323_118|If it does it means he has failed.
p323_119|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p323_120|We have a high quality product.
p323_121|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
p323_122|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p323_123|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
p323_124|It will also take evidence from consumers.
p323_125|I have been to see him.
p323_126|I try not to expect anything.
p323_127|I would never say anything against her.
p323_128|He probably would not have added, mainly by me.
p323_129|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p323_130|I see no need for change.
p323_131|We are in a very strong position.
p323_132|This will have no effect on the championship.
p323_133|We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
p323_134|It was no more than they deserved.
p323_135|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p323_136|I'm just glad that no-one was hurt.
p323_137|Everything was a dead end.
p323_138|It's been a long, long journey.
p323_139|I can give no comment.
p323_140|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
p323_141|What exactly is your job?
p323_142|They would love to do more films.
p323_143|She is now planning a visit.
p323_144|New blood is essential for progress.
p323_145|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p323_146|Boy is the town a mess.
p323_147|Do yourselves a favour.
p323_148|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
p323_149|I said, What does this mean?
p323_150|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p323_151|We can do both.
p323_152|What's it got to do with art?
p323_153|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
p323_154|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
p323_155|The encounter was to change his life.
p323_156|They should not have behaved in that way.
p323_157|I've never seen them down here.
p323_158|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p323_159|I got off to a great start.
p323_160|It's the best of both worlds.
p323_161|That is our unfinished business.
p323_162|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
p323_163|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p323_164|But it was to no avail.
p323_165|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
p323_166|There are so many people to thank.
p323_167|Nato has left them with no other option.
p323_168|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p323_169|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p323_170|The stakes are high.
p323_171|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p323_172|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
p323_173|That's just the way the game is evolving.
p323_174|Michael is putting on a brave face.
p323_175|We have done a deal with IMPACT.
p323_176|O Leary was clearly disgusted.
p323_177|What do they do, anyway?
p323_178|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
p323_179|In the eyes of the supporters, there has been a betrayal.
p323_180|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
p323_181|This is a mental challenge.
p323_182|He was married with children.
p323_183|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p323_184|It would be difficult to argue with that.
p323_185|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
p323_186|The game is now open.
p323_187|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p323_188|Rather than just a way in, she begins with an entrance.
p323_189|Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
p323_190|It is time to come into the limelight.
p323_191|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
p323_192|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p323_193|We have got to get it right.
p323_194|You could see he was thinking about it.
p323_195|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p323_196|We work for the athlete.
p323_197|It was a good atmosphere.
p323_198|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p323_199|It was an accounting error.
p323_200|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
p323_201|It has never been worthwhile.
p323_202|She is not in a coma.
p323_203|There is no reason to put me out.
p323_204|We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.
p323_205|So other options had to be explored.
p323_206|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
p323_207|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p323_208|Post offices are closing now.
p323_209|I am pretty careful with money.
p323_210|People love to see this stuff.
p323_211|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
p323_212|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p323_213|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p323_214|His female companion was being treated for shock.
p323_215|Is being naturally funny enough?
p323_216|Lack of pace is his big problem.
p323_217|I have no plans to change the oath.
p323_218|The process itself has taken over.
p323_219|We had a huge response to that campaign.
p323_220|We did not even get a free kick.
p323_221|He was married with a young child.
p323_222|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p323_223|I became a widow overnight.
p323_224|We aren't going to play better.
p323_225|That was the case with David.
p323_226|They loved it and it showed.
p323_227|But who cares?
p323_228|She became a heroine of my childhood.
p323_229|That period was a struggle.
p323_230|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p323_231|I am an estate agent.
p323_232|The conference will run from Wednesday until Sunday.
p323_233|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
p323_234|Is your life a little too easy?
p323_235|I think my game is suited to grass.
p323_236|Anything can happen - at any moment.
p323_237|He predicted the contest would be very close.
p323_238|Who can say?
p323_239|My life would be a lot less restrictive.
p323_240|The key issue for us is public safety.
p323_241|Nobody wants to stop people enjoying themselves.
p323_242|I went home and wrote about it.
p323_243|The result could be all down to turnout.
p323_244|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
p323_245|There were no violations.
p323_246|It appears to have been closed down.
p323_247|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p323_248|These are exciting times for young Scottish players.
p323_249|People want to see me on the screen.
p323_250|So far he has not done so.
p323_251|Maybe they will show it next year.
p323_252|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p323_253|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p323_254|Everything is up for grabs.
p323_255|Thankfully, for me, the matter is now closed.
p323_256|We are a new department.
p323_257|Are we here?
p323_258|The conversion didn't go over either.
p323_259|He said to me, Which one, son?
p323_260|There is nothing sinister in it.
p323_261|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p323_262|I've got to provide for my family.
p323_263|It is having a big impact.
p323_264|That is very hard, alone.
p323_265|It's a very high number.
p323_266|I was not happy about being left out.
p323_267|Such debate is pointless.
p323_268|It is a very beautiful city.
p323_269|The same goes for Russia.
p323_270|What do you think of the hair?
p323_271|It is not great art.
p323_272|You do not change overnight.
p323_273|We have to break that cycle.
p323_274|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p323_275|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p323_276|Scotland had great assets.
p323_277|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p323_278|Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
p323_279|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p323_280|Have a look at our accounts.
p323_281|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p323_282|It all changes for her.
p323_283|We aim to put them out of business.
p323_284|Is it a threat to union?
p323_285|We also have to work the dark side, if you will.
p323_286|We remain confident that Danny is still alive.
p323_287|Tony Blair should get out more.
p323_288|We need to increase the membership.
p323_289|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p323_290|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p323_291|He was just awesome.
p323_292|No decision has yet been made.
p323_293|Maybe his time has gone.
p323_294|She died in hospital two hours later.
p323_295|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
p323_296|I have never seen anything like it.
p323_297|I've got the shirt.
p323_298|Both were later released after a check-up.
p323_299|We were a little bit nervous.
p323_300|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
p323_301|However, many questions remained unanswered.
p323_302|I first met him last summer.
p323_303|Detection is often difficult.
p323_304|How good is Lennox Lewis?
p323_305|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p323_306|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p323_307|The plot is changing as time goes on.
p323_308|We have other options.
p323_309|I don't want to hear any excuses.
p323_310|The son has autism and other problems.
p323_311|This makes up for it.
p323_312|I'm very puzzled by it.
p323_313|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p323_314|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
p323_315|All things are possible if you believe.
p323_316|The council's concern is very simple.
p323_317|This was not just incongruous.
p323_318|This rule is archaic.
p323_319|Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.
p323_320|It was a virus.
p323_321|My mother was getting on at me.
p323_322|But it wasn't to be.
p323_323|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p323_324|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p323_325|Then there is the terrain.
p323_326|We will deal with the refugees.
p323_327|It's such a shock.
p323_328|The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
p323_329|I didn't know there was anything wrong.
p323_330|It was very well received.
p323_331|If you could find it.
p323_332|Such is the ego involved.
p323_333|She was totally possessed.
p323_334|It was not known to myself.
p323_335|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p323_336|It is a vicious circle.
p323_337|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p323_338|We work on the same level.
p323_339|Angola was a really hard place.
p323_340|It is a love affair.
p323_341|I was loving that little girl.
p323_342|Everyone thought they were safe.
p323_343|People wouldn't have quite understood the language.
p323_344|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
p323_345|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p323_346|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p323_347|Before the game we went for a pint.
p323_348|The auction will be held tomorrow.
p323_349|There is no credible official announcement.
p323_350|However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
p323_351|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p323_352|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p323_353|At the same time it is a satire.
p323_354|He died at the hands of his captors.
p323_355|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
p323_356|I understand the medical concerns.
p323_357|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p323_358|This is a United Kingdom.
p323_359|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p323_360|This is a critical time for football.
p323_361|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
p323_362|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p323_363|I think she is supreme.
p323_364|However, who could have predicted this result?
p323_365|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p323_366|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p323_367|But we're not the same person.
p323_368|There are simply no orders.
p323_369|They were behind the wheel.
p323_370|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p323_371|The problem arises because he does so much.
p323_372|This is totally out of character for Stuart.
p323_373|PR will be just one of them.
p323_374|The answer is mayhem.
p323_375|But the fans deserve to know!
p323_376|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p323_377|He asked how they were doing.
p323_378|We have been extremely lucky this time.
p323_379|I'll have to work on that.
p323_380|He must be seen to be impartial.
p323_381|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p323_382|That will be the sweetness.
p323_383|The law will take its course.
p323_384|The idea has potential for the future.
p323_385|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
p323_386|I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.
p323_387|There was a fossil on screen.
p323_388|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
p323_389|I did not concentrate on my performance.
p323_390|There is great interest on our island.
p323_391|Later they changed their minds.
p323_392|This does not create any precedent.
p323_393|Hours later, she was found dead by Ms Wilson.
p323_394|I want to go home.
p323_395|He already had had complaints.
p323_396|That, however, was only the tip of the iceberg.
p323_397|Of course he does!
p323_398|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p323_399|The racist abuse was terrible.
p323_400|The Farmer is called an idiot.
p323_401|Five officers were injured.
p323_402|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p323_403|We didn't make any of this up.
p323_404|Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
p326_001|Please call Stella.
p326_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p326_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p326_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p326_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p326_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p326_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p326_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p326_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p326_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p326_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p326_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p326_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p326_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p326_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p326_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p326_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p326_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p326_019|Since then physicists have found it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p326_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p326_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p326_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p326_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p326_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p326_025|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
p326_026|The message was clear.
p326_027|She is an angel.
p326_028|It is believed he had been stabbed.
p326_029|We have got to attack.
p326_030|I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
p326_031|United were in control without always being dominant.
p326_032|There we were on the first tee.
p326_033|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
p326_034|At least two women were among those arrested.
p326_035|How would it work?
p326_036|It was my shortest audition.
p326_037|That was a stunning drive from Jon.
p326_038|She didn't tell us anything new.
p326_039|There is nothing like this back home.
p326_040|The police believe the man was not injured.
p326_041|It would be a miracle.
p326_042|We just love to chat.
p326_043|I read about it in the newspapers.
p326_044|What did they think of her voice?
p326_045|They say they feel different.
p326_046|It is a good result for Great Britain.
p326_047|What on earth is wrong with you?
p326_048|We will continue to pressure the Government.
p326_049|His art was not just about emotions.
p326_050|They are all bright and different.
p326_051|I found a fault and worked at it.
p326_052|My position on the euro is quite clear.
p326_053|Labour was too busy to respond.
p326_054|His voice is strong.
p326_055|They may yet have the last laugh.
p326_056|But they add up.
p326_057|You can feel at home in China.
p326_058|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
p326_059|This is all part of opening the door.
p326_060|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p326_061|Mr Blunkett was convinced.
p326_062|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
p326_063|He will become the sovereign.
p326_064|It was a foolhardy decision.
p326_065|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p326_066|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p326_067|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p326_068|Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
p326_069|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p326_070|Messages have to be reinforced.
p326_071|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
p326_072|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p326_073|The Insider opens tomorrow.
p326_074|More patience and composure was required.
p326_075|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p326_076|I was shocked and outraged.
p326_077|It's just gotten too big.
p326_078|We're still in talks and, hopefully, they will continue.
p326_079|I am immensely proud of them.
p326_080|It was extremely cold.
p326_081|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p326_082|No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.
p326_083|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p326_084|They were two different types.
p326_085|Chelsea was a great club.
p326_086|I can't believe it.
p326_087|I couldn't believe it, but it looks like it's true.
p326_088|We have them in offices all over.
p326_089|It need not be like that.
p326_090|There has been a sense of frustration.
p326_091|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
p326_092|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p326_093|This time, there were no such rewards.
p326_094|That'd be good for the whole city.
p326_095|It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
p326_096|We are very very proud of Alain.
p326_097|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p326_098|It was exactly four months away.
p326_099|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
p326_100|It was set in a cafe.
p326_101|It certainly gives you hope.
p326_102|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
p326_103|Brown is an interesting man, but he's not desperate.
p326_104|We've all been there at some point.
p326_105|I'm totally horrified by the sentence.
p326_106|Our people should be immune.
p326_107|It's a metaphor for consumption.
p326_108|I just saw them for a few minutes.
p326_109|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
p326_110|It left me with a sadness.
p326_111|Hopefully they will turn out tonight.
p326_112|The boys are very confident.
p326_113|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p326_114|Thousands of others have not been so fortunate.
p326_115|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p326_116|What she will do next?
p326_117|Hopefully, everything is for the best.
p326_118|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
p326_119|She has now been registered as disabled.
p326_120|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
p326_121|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p326_122|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p326_123|That is a data management problem.
p326_124|Nor is he allowed out without permission.
p326_125|He looked very sharp.
p326_126|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p326_127|I've beaten her a few times.
p326_128|His father and mother are in film production.
p326_129|This is not a long-term commitment.
p326_130|It's about attitudes to change.
p326_131|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
p326_132|Yet she is one of the lucky ones.
p326_133|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
p326_134|That means no more taxation by stealth.
p326_135|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
p326_136|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p326_137|People tended to stay there for some time.
p326_138|Holland won by five wickets.
p326_139|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
p326_140|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
p326_141|We are not going to forget.
p326_142|I'm the one that said it.
p326_143|It's not hard to get involved.
p326_144|I've grown up a bit.
p326_145|For a moment it was all about her.
p326_146|It changed my life.
p326_147|Once they go away they won't come back.
p326_148|It's a difficult one to comment on.
p326_149|Our position is clear.
p326_150|Yet it does not lose appeal.
p326_151|But what will we put on it?
p326_152|Then in came a succession of signings.
p326_153|It will benefit a lot of people.
p326_154|A new school will be built.
p326_155|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
p326_156|It is worse because she suffers from angina.
p326_157|I felt he was excellent.
p326_158|It's not just a male agenda.
p326_159|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p326_160|I think we believed the tie was won.
p326_161|She wanted to move.
p326_162|How do you find the youngsters?
p326_163|It's always a rehearsal.
p326_164|But it's a subtle process.
p326_165|We all have to look in the mirror.
p326_166|There is no internal damage.
p326_167|About the bad things that happened to me.
p326_168|She is a very lucky young lady.
p326_169|It was a great team effort.
p326_170|The threat to rural areas is real.
p326_171|Tourism continues to struggle.
p326_172|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
p326_173|Its first awards will do just that.
p326_174|We are already under pressure.
p326_175|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p326_176|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p326_177|The Scottish management team will settle for that.
p326_178|THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
p326_179|He didn't have long to wait.
p326_180|That was merely their initial problem.
p326_181|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
p326_182|It would be really interesting if they did.
p326_183|I need them to set my career.
p326_184|I love the Scottish and the Irish people.
p326_185|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
p326_186|He was all blackened.
p326_187|This is your country.
p326_188|I want to be there by right.
p326_189|The fund has three elements.
p326_190|You've just got to move on.
p326_191|I feel really good.
p326_192|So You Think You Want  to be Victoria?
p326_193|This is still a young team, you know.
p326_194|It's just the workings of the Scottish media.
p326_195|The British government said she was coming home.
p326_196|It's not even finished.
p326_197|That is a matter for Mr Graham.
p326_198|These people just lost their child.
p326_199|Everyone knew where they were.
p326_200|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p326_201|It was worth a photograph.
p326_202|The processing plant was closed yesterday.
p326_203|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p326_204|Was this a new event?
p326_205|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
p326_206|In the old days, it was easy.
p326_207|I came into this world with nothing.
p326_208|We're still hopeful of concluding the deal.
p326_209|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p326_210|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p326_211|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
p326_212|His style is suited to Scottish football.
p326_213|After that he became more romantic.
p326_214|It's not long enough.
p326_215|My view has now completely changed.
p326_216|You're going to take away my life.
p326_217|He scored a touchdown.
p326_218|They finished second and third.
p326_219|We're playing away from home and that's it.
p326_220|He was then replaced by Ross.
p326_221|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
p326_222|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p326_223|She did not attend the courtroom.
p326_224|People can get them if they want.
p326_225|Smith confirmed that their confidence was returning.
p326_226|He is a law unto himself.
p326_227|I was very, very happy.
p326_228|No-one should see that.
p326_229|We are going to go about our lives.
p326_230|What is the point of jailing him?
p326_231|They made it very difficult for us.
p326_232|Well, there is a bed.
p326_233|You write a play.
p326_234|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
p326_235|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p326_236|Seems a sensible compromise.
p326_237|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
p326_238|I'm happy with the outcome.
p326_239|An aide was instructed to get a copy.
p326_240|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p326_241|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p326_242|The vacancies are in support services and arts.
p326_243|It is just completely erased.
p326_244|His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.
p326_245|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p326_246|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p326_247|Scotland were on Saturday.
p326_248|I enjoy playing with both of them.
p326_249|Too often it is not.
p326_250|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p326_251|I tend not to look back.
p326_252|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p326_253|The real problem is the Usher Hall.
p326_254|My family, health and golf is always a balancing act.
p326_255|I got a yellow card.
p326_256|My game just seems to keep on improving.
p326_257|We would expect it to disappear in time.
p326_258|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
p326_259|I'd love to have been on the pitch.
p326_260|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p326_261|I didn't know what he was capable of.
p326_262|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
p326_263|I ran to get out of the way.
p326_264|She's now on the back benches.
p326_265|But there are some problems.
p326_266|It may also be her last.
p326_267|It should not lose out in any way.
p326_268|We're very pleased about the verdict.
p326_269|It will not be a long campaign.
p326_270|Subs not used, McGraw.
p326_271|Maybe it helps us.
p326_272|Three bystanders were killed.
p326_273|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p326_274|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p326_275|Was it just negligent.
p326_276|He made no big mistakes.
p326_277|It will not be today, though.
p326_278|Which is a shame.
p326_279|That is where our future lies.
p326_280|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p326_281|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p326_282|That was enough for the committee.
p326_283|We will be homeless.
p326_284|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p326_285|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p326_286|Sure, this is a very important event for me.
p326_287|We have to focus on what is important.
p326_288|They have to work so hard.
p326_289|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p326_290|Well, was it?
p326_291|That's my big challenge.
p326_292|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p326_293|We have to adapt to this level.
p326_294|So what is it with Nato?
p326_295|We won't let you down.
p326_296|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p326_297|There's a strong involvement.
p326_298|The observer saw no evidence ofr fighting.
p326_299|He was visited by UK consular officials.
p326_300|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
p326_301|English is the language of pop music.
p326_302|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p326_303|It is a simple equation.
p326_304|It makes a huge difference.
p326_305|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p326_306|She has seen, or heard, it all.
p326_307|Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
p326_308|Could you put it in writing?
p326_309|They play together perfectly.
p326_310|We will meet again.
p326_311|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p326_312|The other conditions were not specified.
p326_313|They should use it on the catwalk.
p326_314|Perhaps it is the Crown Estate.
p326_315|We're looking at the Citizens Theatre the Lyceum.
p326_316|It certainly sounded it at times.
p326_317|Anyone can take a photo.
p326_318|We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
p326_319|They treated me with respect and courtesy.
p326_320|He is involved in everything.
p326_321|Family, if you like.
p326_322|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p326_323|I don't want to change anything.
p326_324|I've only met him three times.
p326_325|You see, my back has gone.
p326_326|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p326_327|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
p326_328|We are the weakest link.
p326_329|It had been on the cards.
p326_330|She looked very, very poor.
p326_331|He did, and he missed.
p326_332|Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
p326_333|Many innocent people will die.
p326_334|The mood was defiant.
p326_335|We have now no choice.
p326_336|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p326_337|Butcher has only one idea in mind.
p326_338|It's our worst nightmare.
p326_339|We gave them the goal.
p326_340|Self control is just one instalment.
p326_341|It would be a massive boost for them.
p326_342|You never had it so good.
p326_343|Both are national treasures.
p326_344|The then secretary was not amused.
p326_345|I can't speak for him.
p326_346|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p326_347|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p326_348|I can't see him reversing that.
p326_349|He was on a horse.
p326_350|I'm really looking forward to it.
p326_351|Capital gains tax is also being reduced.
p326_352|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
p326_353|And that gives a kind of freedom.
p326_354|I have also been delighted with Stevie.
p326_355|He's on the wrong side.
p326_356|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p326_357|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p326_358|Labour is providing none of these.
p326_359|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p326_360|There is no musical background in his family.
p326_361|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p326_362|The mix with Tiger is perfect.
p326_363|There were no immediate reports of injuries.
p326_364|Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
p326_366|Finally action had been taken.
p326_367|We're not travel agents.
p326_368|It's hard not to.
p326_369|Broke down and can't be fixed.
p326_370|I'm desperate to play in this match.
p326_371|That's always the case, isn't it?
p326_372|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p326_373|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p326_374|It is patently true.
p326_375|They did not threaten anyone.
p326_376|There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.
p326_377|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p326_378|But sometimes it works out all right.
p326_379|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
p326_380|Even then he was in the media spotlight.
p329_001|Please call Stella.
p329_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p329_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p329_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p329_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p329_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p329_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p329_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p329_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p329_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p329_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p329_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p329_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p329_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p329_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p329_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p329_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p329_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p329_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p329_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p329_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p329_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p329_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p329_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p329_025|But there has never been the time, she said.
p329_026|This could be one such case, he declared.
p329_027|It's not a solo.
p329_028|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p329_029|I fell in love with ballet.
p329_030|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
p329_031|I had found my vision.
p329_032|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p329_033|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
p329_034|We don't know the scale of need.
p329_035|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p329_036|We had a huge response to that campaign.
p329_037|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p329_038|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p329_039|We're still talking with a few people.
p329_040|We know you will not let us down.
p329_041|He will never walk the streets again.
p329_042|There are big names.
p329_043|That argument has been won.
p329_044|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p329_045|I hope you will leave it at that.
p329_046|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p329_047|The bill would be massive.
p329_048|He was just a journalist.
p329_049|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p329_050|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
p329_051|I didn't have a clue.
p329_052|How can they engage with the work?
p329_053|I have been coming here for nine years.
p329_054|She has a wonderful mind.
p329_055|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p329_056|We're into that build-up now.
p329_057|It is the end of an era.
p329_058|I have had no social life at all.
p329_059|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p329_060|In short, the club was broke.
p329_061|His charisma is all on the course.
p329_062|I am still pretty young in this business.
p329_063|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p329_064|We're not the tourist board.
p329_065|It was the same old story.
p329_066|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
p329_067|The Commons is too outdated.
p329_068|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
p329_069|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p329_070|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
p329_071|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p329_072|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p329_073|He would be with his peers.
p329_074|They seem to be backing off from that.
p329_075|This will be no easy option.
p329_076|I wish they, too, would get a grip.
p329_077|I am so sorry.
p329_078|This avalanche is just beginning.
p329_079|It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
p329_080|We will see how he is after treatment.
p329_081|I was there for five hours.
p329_082|But then he changed his mind.
p329_083|I don't know why she is not here.
p329_084|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p329_085|There are no excuses.
p329_086|I feel very strongly about that.
p329_087|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p329_088|He just wants to play.
p329_089|It's very difficult and very worrying.
p329_090|Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
p329_091|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
p329_092|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p329_093|I want to play at the highest level.
p329_094|Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
p329_095|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p329_096|Jamming would be equally difficult.
p329_097|Drugs are always an issue.
p329_098|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p329_099|This kind of problem arises everywhere.
p329_100|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p329_101|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p329_102|There is no guarantee.
p329_103|We make good weapons.
p329_104|I'm confident we can turn things around.
p329_105|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
p329_106|The news was yesterday welcomed by union leaders.
p329_107|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p329_108|It may be argued.
p329_109|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p329_110|I bought a car at auction.
p329_111|They agree to meet.
p329_112|They could not hear.
p329_113|It has been hijacked.
p329_114|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
p329_115|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p329_116|She had been sexually assaulted.
p329_117|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
p329_118|That is different from being impartial.
p329_119|Both offices were closed yesterday.
p329_120|They don't have to, but they normally do.
p329_121|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p329_122|David was not either.
p329_123|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p329_124|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p329_125|More patience and composure was required.
p329_126|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p329_127|There is no smoking gun.
p329_128|The trial is set for February.
p329_129|I didn't play well last year.
p329_130|It was an ambush.
p329_131|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p329_132|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
p329_133|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p329_134|Is that too much to ask?
p329_135|I have so much respect for him.
p329_136|Each one has its own system.
p329_137|I felt under no pressure today.
p329_138|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p329_139|And that was the adults.
p329_140|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p329_141|That is a job for the Government.
p329_142|And he had much need.
p329_143|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p329_144|The other children were severely mentally impaired.
p329_145|This can only help us go forward.
p329_146|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p329_147|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p329_148|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
p329_149|I hadn't been looking after myself.
p329_150|And really, the songs are the key thing.
p329_151|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p329_152|Perhaps they knew something we didn't.
p329_153|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
p329_154|The whole experience has left me bitter.
p329_155|I guess it is down to focus.
p329_156|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p329_157|I have great respect for all my players.
p329_158|His track record is not promising.
p329_159|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p329_160|For a moment it was all about her.
p329_161|It will be a great night.
p329_162|Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
p329_163|Trading Places was too obvious.
p329_164|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p329_165|That's the way it is.
p329_166|We've been calling for a level playing field.
p329_167|I see the extended family once a year.
p329_168|I am not a magician.
p329_169|We couldn't go very fast.
p329_170|There was even a joke.
p329_171|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p329_172|You probably have never seen them before.
p329_173|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p329_174|She had experience of the wildest places.
p329_175|It is highly unlikely.
p329_176|The show is small but perfectly formed.
p329_177|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p329_178|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p329_179|It is too early to speculate.
p329_180|I love the moment of being first.
p329_181|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p329_182|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p329_183|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p329_184|Or so we have long assumed.
p329_185|They responded with victories.
p329_186|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p329_187|What is the truth about the cow?
p329_188|They will want to watch a winning team.
p329_189|I think it's awful.
p329_190|Who is going to be penalised?
p329_191|This will be just another tax on motorists.
p329_192|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p329_193|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p329_194|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p329_195|It is a scandal.
p329_196|Nor should there have been.
p329_197|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p329_198|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p329_199|I have a theory.
p329_200|But these were the nights.
p329_201|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p329_202|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p329_203|I am aware that somebody made a threat.
p329_204|He was jailed for five years.
p329_205|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p329_206|We will not break even.
p329_207|We will look into it.
p329_208|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
p329_209|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p329_210|What did they think of her voice?
p329_211|But he's not afraid to take risks.
p329_212|Three years probation is just a joke.
p329_213|We did not talk about it.
p329_214|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p329_215|The court has not decided.
p329_216|We are opening an inquiry.
p329_217|I get to work with very good people.
p329_218|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p329_219|We find this very sad.
p329_220|Four people died instantly.
p329_221|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
p329_222|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p329_223|I'm really happy with the way it went.
p329_224|It is a step on the way.
p329_225|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p329_226|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p329_227|People tended to stay there for some time.
p329_228|All businesses continue to trade.
p329_229|It's a difficult job.
p329_230|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p329_231|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p329_232|This represents a tough game for us.
p329_233|The boy is no longer with us.
p329_234|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p329_235|This is my new career.
p329_236|It really was a masterful innings.
p329_237|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p329_238|I would urge the Government to think again.
p329_239|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p329_240|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p329_241|I was happiest with my short game.
p329_242|I leave tonight for England.
p329_243|There is no change in our position.
p329_244|Everything else is a bonus.
p329_245|We went on to become very successful.
p329_246|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
p329_247|We must learn from the past.
p329_248|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
p329_249|We told them in August.
p329_250|That could be at least five years away.
p329_251|That is my role.
p329_252|I have no comment to make.
p329_253|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
p329_254|He also presented You Bet!
p329_255|I just went a bit too far.
p329_256|And how he kept his word.
p329_257|This is a wonderful honour for me.
p329_258|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p329_259|He was a crazy man.
p329_260|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p329_261|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p329_262|I have no argument with Scotland.
p329_263|And a film maker was born.
p329_264|It was also put on the Internet.
p329_265|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
p329_266|I hope he stays.
p329_267|He also has a Scottish grandfather.
p329_268|Now that was a boxing movie.
p329_269|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p329_270|There was a battle there.
p329_271|I might also completely change the routine.
p329_272|Today's ruling confirms that fact.
p329_273|It's good news and long overdue.
p329_274|I'd never heard him in person before.
p329_275|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
p329_276|I saw them not long after it happened.
p329_277|He doesn't do dinner.
p329_278|He has been campaigning for change for years.
p329_279|That's a very strong element.
p329_280|A formal decision will be announced within months.
p329_281|I have beaten her a few times.
p329_282|He was at home with his pals.
p329_283|We are taking it seriously.
p329_284|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p329_285|Maybe this battle has been.
p329_286|The manager is there to make these decisions.
p329_287|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p329_288|Then followed a bout of flu.
p329_289|I have worked with him on projects.
p329_290|We had no part in it.
p329_291|His father and mother are in film production.
p329_292|The methadone programme is completely out of control.
p329_293|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p329_294|The referee had been right.
p329_295|Our young people are leaving.
p329_296|That would have been too easy.
p329_297|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p329_298|This is not a faceless system.
p329_299|This is a long-term discussion paper.
p329_300|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p329_301|That is just a load of baloney.
p329_302|I'm feeling very pleased.
p329_303|The damage from the fire was huge.
p329_304|She had kept the news from him.
p329_305|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p329_306|But we'll just keep trying to get results.
p329_307|A play is a set of actions.
p329_308|Clearly, that is important in nursing.
p329_309|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p329_310|The campaign was raucous.
p329_311|Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
p329_312|But both were involved with other matters.
p329_313|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
p329_314|However, in October another partnership was announced.
p329_315|There is no threat to them.
p329_316|The time is up for Iraq to comply.
p329_317|Nelson does not disappoint.
p329_318|The woman is basically off her head.
p329_319|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p329_320|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p329_321|It is high time to act.
p329_322|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p329_323|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p329_324|The South African defended his work ethic.
p329_325|Pressure of work is no excuse.
p329_326|There was barely a handful of chances.
p329_327|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p329_328|But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
p329_329|I can't believe something like this could happen.
p329_330|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
p329_331|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
p329_332|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p329_333|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
p329_334|That is not the way we should operate.
p329_335|The new work will begin in the autumn.
p329_336|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p329_337|We have nothing to hide.
p329_338|It might have been a satanic ritual.
p329_339|I'll take the blame for that.
p329_340|It is now time for justice.
p329_341|That is no use.
p329_342|There is great interest on our island.
p329_343|But he is frustrated at every turn.
p329_344|Our house was very small.
p329_345|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
p329_346|Later they changed their minds.
p329_347|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
p329_348|First is open defiance.
p329_349|That is absolute nonsense.
p329_350|I just had so much fun.
p329_351|It was quite rigorous.
p329_352|It is a decision which has paid off.
p329_353|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p329_354|Their mind was already made up.
p329_355|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p329_356|We do not expect any surplus.
p329_357|You don't do the same thing with men.
p329_358|Just don't go looking to be shocked.
p329_359|Pray that it is so.
p329_360|No, is the answer to your first question.
p329_361|There was support from across the board.
p329_362|There may be some evidence to this effect.
p329_363|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
p329_364|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p329_365|We have been preparing all year.
p329_366|The position on the euro remains unchanged.
p329_367|So what does one do?
p329_368|Such actions are rarely popular.
p329_369|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p329_370|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p329_371|I joined a group.
p329_372|The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
p329_373|They probably expected something special from me.
p329_374|But we could not change his mind.
p329_375|We have a team to reach the final.
p329_376|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
p329_377|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p329_378|I see no reason for them to be.
p329_379|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p329_380|I never agreed with that.
p329_381|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p329_382|He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
p329_383|He added, however, that all options are under review.
p329_384|It is a dilemma.
p329_385|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p329_386|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p329_387|There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
p329_388|They did not interfere.
p329_389|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p329_390|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p329_391|I'm happy to contribute to that.
p329_392|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p329_393|My father died in childbirth.
p329_394|As if he were a High Court judge.
p329_395|And that started me thinking.
p329_396|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p329_397|It brings together two essential elements.
p329_398|The issue has still to be resolved.
p329_399|He is a joy to watch.
p329_400|We have high hopes that this will work.
p329_401|We are now open.
p329_402|People ask about the concept of a team.
p329_403|Who has he fought?
p329_404|The film is about the cost of genius.
p330_001|Please call Stella.
p330_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p330_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p330_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p330_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p330_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p330_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p330_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p330_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p330_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p330_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p330_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p330_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p330_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p330_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p330_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p330_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p330_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p330_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p330_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p330_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p330_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p330_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p330_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p330_025|Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
p330_026|I was backing him up.
p330_027|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p330_028|Surely history will not repeat itself.
p330_029|That was their attitude.
p330_030|It was nothing to do with my daughter.
p330_031|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p330_032|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p330_033|And it had two seats.
p330_034|They could move in at any moment.
p330_035|There were no reported injuries.
p330_036|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
p330_037|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p330_038|It is my nature.
p330_039|Or so she thought.
p330_040|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p330_041|This advice was accepted by ministers.
p330_042|We did not even get a free kick.
p330_043|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
p330_044|Our decision making was poor.
p330_045|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p330_046|They said we were out of touch.
p330_047|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p330_048|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
p330_049|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p330_050|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p330_051|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
p330_052|He has one son and one daughter.
p330_053|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p330_054|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
p330_055|Scotland had great assets.
p330_056|We shall not forget him.
p330_057|And thought we would get away with it.
p330_058|I think they should have more respect.
p330_059|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p330_060|This is a big club.
p330_061|I find it rather oppressive.
p330_062|Many, many people don't know who he is.
p330_063|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p330_064|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p330_065|We have to expand.
p330_066|Others may be trying to catch up.
p330_067|We gave everything we had.
p330_068|I think it is a release of tension.
p330_069|This is a most serious matter.
p330_070|I let go the telephone and ran.
p330_071|It is also very valuable.
p330_072|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
p330_073|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p330_074|This makes up for it.
p330_075|This is purely financial.
p330_076|I want to help other women.
p330_077|The problem is Labour.
p330_078|The way ahead is not easy.
p330_079|I could do a better job.
p330_080|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p330_081|An announcement will follow in due course.
p330_082|I am here to play football.
p330_083|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p330_084|That is the crunch.
p330_085|I did not want any damage to us.
p330_086|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p330_087|It was an easy decision to come here.
p330_088|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
p330_089|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
p330_090|Everything has the potential to be serious.
p330_091|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p330_092|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p330_093|This will be great for the young lads.
p330_094|He needed seven hours of surgery.
p330_095|Who said impatience is a virtue?
p330_096|What do we do for an encore?
p330_097|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p330_098|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p330_099|There's nothing for the kids.
p330_100|Creative, expressive football was the order of the day.
p330_101|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p330_102|The feeling is marvellous.
p330_103|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p330_104|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p330_105|The conductor, too, will have adjustments to make.
p330_106|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p330_107|I'm astonished the men were not injured.
p330_108|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p330_109|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p330_110|The money is not really our concern.
p330_111|You just know it.
p330_112|Wallace was in at the deep end.
p330_113|Don't say you have not been warned.
p330_114|Some were close to tears.
p330_115|Seven children had lost both parents.
p330_116|So, how will it be received in the US?
p330_117|The government was consulting interested parties, he added.
p330_118|Above all, he was knocked out by the choir.
p330_119|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
p330_120|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
p330_121|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p330_122|Some people still think she should be English.
p330_123|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p330_124|Repayment is not part of the game.
p330_125|Who will perform?
p330_126|It's like a high school play.
p330_127|He was part of South Africa.
p330_128|It's much more dynamic.
p330_129|The party will make up its own mind.
p330_130|What do they pay to join the club?
p330_131|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
p330_132|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p330_133|We are now in a safe place.
p330_134|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
p330_135|The reason, of course, was Iraq.
p330_136|It will be very useful for us.
p330_137|He was obviously very genuine.
p330_138|We told them in July.
p330_139|It's like a garage.
p330_140|He will be judged by his actions.
p330_141|No Briton has ever won.
p330_142|The answer is with ourselves.
p330_143|That is the last thing they need.
p330_144|Was society doing enough?
p330_145|The results are sometimes contentious.
p330_146|I never thought it would take this long.
p330_147|He changed my life.
p330_148|There was nothing else to match it.
p330_149|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p330_150|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
p330_151|They have worked with each other.
p330_152|O, Is there a lot of blood?
p330_153|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p330_154|That will alter the dynamics of Scottish politics.
p330_155|His parenthood is called into question.
p330_156|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p330_157|But it could have been written for her.
p330_158|His only reply was a laugh.
p330_159|I'm really looking forward to it.
p330_160|A report will be issued by March.
p330_161|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p330_162|The party lasted all night.
p330_163|I was delighted with every one of them.
p330_164|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
p330_165|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
p330_166|It was horrible, but there is still more.
p330_167|I was proud of our lads.
p330_168|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
p330_169|This is not a Scottish problem.
p330_170|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
p330_171|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p330_172|After that, we made some changes.
p330_173|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p330_174|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p330_175|Scotland were beaten again.
p330_176|Glasgow is a tour de force.
p330_177|I have no battle with the Scots.
p330_178|The League of Nations was also his idea.
p330_179|I've done it almost like a variety show.
p330_180|He urged Mr Blair to get out more.
p330_181|She is on a life support machine.
p330_182|The actor has met with Mandela.
p330_183|Euro The single currency is a fact.
p330_184|This is a dream come true for me.
p330_185|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p330_186|I think it'll be a great occasion.
p330_187|He went to see what he could learn.
p330_188|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
p330_189|A board of inquiry has already been convened.
p330_190|We're not an employment agency.
p330_191|It has all been positive.
p330_192|Referees are easy targets.
p330_193|It's not one or the other, you have to have both.
p330_194|No government has that right.
p330_195|The luxury has been well used.
p330_196|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p330_197|Billie was yet to be born.
p330_198|She died in hospital two hours later.
p330_199|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p330_200|This is a good result for them.
p330_201|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p330_202|There was no time scale.
p330_203|Our message was inclusive.
p330_204|She was right about the struggle.
p330_205|Only the scale of change differed.
p330_206|That was one very hard game.
p330_207|I think the euro has slipped.
p330_208|We began to walk down.
p330_209|I will not take you out of context.
p330_210|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p330_211|The cold war is over.
p330_212|I'd like to take the plunge.
p330_213|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p330_214|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p330_215|It had to be more flexible.
p330_216|We are not far from a deal.
p330_217|Are there muscular problems?
p330_218|You remember how long he lasted?
p330_219|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
p330_220|Ordering online was very easy.
p330_221|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p330_222|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p330_223|I think it is a great idea.
p330_224|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p330_225|But it's just great to have won.
p330_226|We're going to see more extreme weather.
p330_227|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p330_228|All these women were actors.
p330_229|I've got no secret.
p330_230|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p330_231|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p330_232|What happened to me last week was wrong.
p330_233|I never made any offer to Mark.
p330_234|To a level which we consider appropriate.
p330_235|That is the first thing we need.
p330_236|Will they ever reopen?
p330_237|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p330_238|We have great team spirit.
p330_239|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p330_240|A national strike would be dangerous and damaging.
p330_241|We have to concentrate on three points tomorrow.
p330_242|You would fall over, he said.
p330_243|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
p330_244|They should take their mobile phones.
p330_245|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p330_246|Mr Finnie, however, said his hands were tied.
p330_247|They are also exploited by the markets.
p330_248|The principle is quite clear.
p330_249|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
p330_250|The board of governors must act.
p330_251|We must all play our part.
p330_252|I first met him last summer.
p330_253|It was to be published next month.
p330_254|That is a break with tradition.
p330_255|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p330_256|It could have been a hammering by now.
p330_257|Last night, the centre issued a statement to the contrary.
p330_258|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p330_259|Subs not used, Fernandez.
p330_260|The question is, Is that a negative?
p330_261|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p330_262|I played really well on the back nine.
p330_263|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p330_264|He will decide tomorrow.
p330_265|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
p330_266|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
p330_267|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
p330_268|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p330_269|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
p330_270|That is our main aim.
p330_271|For this government, reform and resources go together.
p330_272|I always knew she was funny.
p330_273|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
p330_274|All kinds of things occur.
p330_275|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p330_276|I expected these kind of questions.
p330_277|The film has also been superbly designed.
p330_278|It was fit for royalty.
p330_279|It is always the same, isn't it?
p330_280|Who would take it now, after all this?
p330_281|I felt really good until Friday.
p330_282|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p330_283|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p330_284|Equity declined to comment.
p330_285|There is precious little middle ground.
p330_286|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
p330_287|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p330_288|They were both delightful to work with.
p330_289|It's my delight on a shiny night.
p330_290|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
p330_291|It's now down in black and white.
p330_292|Twaddle is a case in point.
p330_293|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p330_294|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p330_295|There were no formal announcements.
p330_296|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p330_297|That was quite an interesting part.
p330_298|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
p330_299|Motion described it as a unique event.
p330_300|We have to offer value for money.
p330_301|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p330_302|Chris is big and jolly.
p330_303|It is quite an eye opener.
p330_304|It became a national network.
p330_305|They still have the dirty work to do.
p330_306|I do not want to wait until May.
p330_307|The festival idea has been a great success.
p330_308|We really need research to help with that.
p330_309|We all work for nothing.
p330_310|It is extremely popular with families.
p330_311|He will do very well.
p330_312|It was a cry for help.
p330_313|They also intend to travel today.
p330_314|There's a lot of hysteria.
p330_315|The casualties were not named.
p330_316|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
p330_317|Axis itself was created from that exercise.
p330_318|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p330_319|It's just that we see different things.
p330_320|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p330_321|I am very happy with life.
p330_322|We are all family men with children.
p330_323|The committee's remit is far reaching.
p330_324|We've had our problems at the club.
p330_325|The plot is changing as time goes on.
p330_326|They were at her bedside when she died.
p330_327|I think we showed that after half time.
p330_328|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p330_329|I am not in denial.
p330_330|There is a solution, she believes.
p330_331|Yet the data is compelling.
p330_332|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p330_333|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
p330_334|What are you waiting for?
p330_335|It could have been just a quick fix.
p330_336|Will he be given time?
p330_337|You let a lot of people down.
p330_338|It's annoying in a way.
p330_339|The result today is an impasse.
p330_340|It would have to be backdated.
p330_341|One person was believed to have been hit.
p330_342|It is like being a qualifier again.
p330_343|And he's the first to see that, and say that.
p330_344|Our biggest threat is the BBC.
p330_345|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p330_346|She is very upset.
p330_347|We have to learn lessons from these things.
p330_348|It was a poor performance.
p330_349|We are very very proud of Alain.
p330_350|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p330_351|There was no sign that anything was amiss.
p330_352|It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
p330_353|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
p330_354|It is patently true.
p330_355|I've got my own ideas.
p330_356|The guys have really enjoyed it.
p330_357|They might want to play.
p330_358|The goal will stay with me forever.
p330_359|Our people should be immune.
p330_360|It is simple and easy to use.
p330_361|Today's agreement will help tackle that problem.
p330_362|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
p330_363|It is the way they work.
p330_364|This was another video cassette.
p330_365|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p330_366|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p330_367|I think we finished fifth.
p330_368|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p330_369|We know them as mobile telephones.
p330_370|I have chosen to do this research.
p330_371|That's the law of the land.
p330_372|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p330_373|He scored a touchdown.
p330_374|He wouldn't do it.
p330_375|I don't know exactly what happened.
p330_376|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p330_377|We are waiting for them to calm down.
p330_378|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p330_379|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p330_380|Debate is not just talk.
p330_381|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p330_382|Neither was involved in violence.
p330_383|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
p330_384|So people will come out with these things.
p330_385|It was a very difficult decision for us.
p330_386|I am not a happy man.
p330_387|Was it just negligent.
p330_388|That would open the gates of hell.
p330_389|If only we had known.
p330_390|The line-up is a tasty one.
p330_391|He was located after going to Singapore.
p330_392|She was my big sister.
p330_393|Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
p330_394|They will now get that support.
p330_395|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p330_396|Then  all was revealed.
p330_397|They are interior designers and architects.
p330_398|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
p330_399|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p330_400|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
p330_401|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
p330_402|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p330_403|They had given up on him.
p330_404|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p333_001|Please call Stella.
p333_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p333_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p333_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p333_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p333_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p333_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p333_008|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p333_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p333_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p333_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p333_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p333_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p333_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p333_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p333_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p333_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p333_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p333_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p333_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p333_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p333_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p333_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p333_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p333_025|He needed seven hours of surgery.
p333_026|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p333_027|But who shot the president?
p333_028|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p333_030|All would be under threat.
p333_031|Some will be deployed on submarines.
p333_032|There are moments of silence.
p333_033|So now this series has had its day.
p333_034|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p333_035|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
p333_036|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p333_037|They were urged to get themselves in order.
p333_038|Too many factors are now working against him.
p333_039|His views are hardly surprising.
p333_040|It is time for a new approach.
p333_041|We have nothing to say about that.
p333_042|We've tried every other way.
p333_043|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
p333_044|Nobody else was with me.
p333_045|However, the report was incorrect.
p333_046|It does make a big difference.
p333_047|Do not forget about Monaco.
p333_048|Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
p333_049|You can't give in to the vandals.
p333_050|Everything was an effort.
p333_051|And does it even matter?
p333_052|This is the same old story.
p333_053|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p333_054|My parents are exhausted.
p333_055|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p333_056|The performance was excellent.
p333_057|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p333_058|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p333_059|It will come up here.
p333_060|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p333_061|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p333_062|The chief constable is right.
p333_063|I didn't expect to get one.
p333_064|It has been blown out of all proportion.
p333_065|This is only the start of my season.
p333_066|It sounded awfully like panic.
p333_067|I've taken to the hills.
p333_068|John was a very nice man.
p333_069|This is a big, big win.
p333_070|The crowd was awesome.
p333_071|Every game against New Zealand is.
p333_072|The jury is still out on this one.
p333_073|My game is in pretty good shape.
p333_074|That would have killed the match.
p333_075|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p333_076|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p333_077|They had not been handcuffed.
p333_078|I think we will join the single currency.
p333_079|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p333_080|But the tragedy did not stop there.
p333_081|They wanted to show what they could do.
p333_082|It runs until the beginning of June.
p333_083|All of us do.
p333_084|But will they fall in love?
p333_085|It was different from our other work.
p333_086|That is in the public domain.
p333_087|The Hague is too good for him.
p333_088|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p333_089|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
p333_090|It's a true story.
p333_091|We are looking for volunteers.
p333_092|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p333_093|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
p333_094|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p333_095|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p333_096|He could face a jail sentence.
p333_097|They didn't take you to mass graves.
p333_098|There was no option.
p333_099|Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
p333_100|Could they perhaps be related?
p333_101|Happily we found it in the library.
p333_102|We all thought we were going to die.
p333_103|Maybe he will act again.
p333_104|Safety was also an issue.
p333_105|That's why he visited.
p333_106|I know a lot of people who don't.
p333_107|There was nobody on the roof.
p333_108|Clark is back on top form.
p333_109|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p333_110|It needs somebody to give way.
p333_111|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p333_112|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p333_113|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
p333_114|The days of empty promises are over.
p333_115|I thought he was terrific.
p333_116|Henry was strong and talented.
p333_117|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p333_118|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p333_119|We must improve our relations with government.
p333_120|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p333_121|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p333_122|A venue was found.
p333_123|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p333_124|He said it was the worst possible result.
p333_125|Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
p333_126|This is our way to make our point.
p333_127|It was a disaster.
p333_128|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p333_129|He was back to square one.
p333_130|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p333_131|I have been coming here for nine years.
p333_132|It is just part of modern day life.
p333_133|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p333_134|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p333_135|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p333_136|YOU thought it was a headache.
p333_137|All the people thought that he would die.
p333_138|It is never an easy game.
p333_139|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p333_140|No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
p333_141|The post will run for four years.
p333_142|However, it's good to turn the page.
p333_143|He had reason to be pleased.
p333_144|It was important to win the singles.
p333_145|That is impressive by any standards.
p333_146|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p333_147|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p333_148|That alibi is now gone.
p333_149|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p333_150|The Scots are great.
p333_151|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p333_152|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
p333_153|I will certainly be having words with him.
p333_154|She is a valuable member of the Government.
p333_155|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p333_156|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p333_157|But he is not using them.
p333_158|Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
p333_159|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p333_160|We are not moving in.
p333_161|It was a breathtaking moment.
p333_162|That's been our position all along.
p333_163|I was in jail for five years.
p333_164|There are no charges.
p333_165|His funeral is not expected until next week.
p333_166|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p333_167|I am very, very happy.
p333_168|They got the job done.
p333_169|They tried to give her advice.
p333_170|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p333_171|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p333_172|It's going to be epic.
p333_173|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p333_174|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p333_175|He just carried on filming.
p333_176|He will be judged by his actions.
p333_177|I never found my rhythm.
p333_178|I didn't mean to kill her.
p333_179|It is a job creation scheme.
p333_180|In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
p333_181|We might be back next year.
p333_182|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p333_183|The same goes for personnel.
p333_184|In a way he was.
p333_185|This area is perfect for children.
p333_186|No, they have not.
p333_187|The feeling between the two men was mutual.
p333_188|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p333_189|I was chosen to do this.
p333_190|The weekly average was three hours.
p333_191|When he took over it really took off.
p333_192|I have been very nervous.
p333_193|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p333_194|There was an element of jealousy.
p333_195|There was no happy ending.
p333_196|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p333_197|I didn't play well last year.
p333_198|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p333_199|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p333_200|Now it has been eclipsed.
p333_201|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p333_202|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p333_203|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p333_204|It is legally binding.
p333_205|It has come as a bombshell.
p333_206|Before the games it was pretty open.
p333_207|We didn't know he was even out.
p333_208|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p333_209|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p333_210|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p333_211|They must be kept on the ground.
p333_212|We still don't know.
p333_213|Police have appealed for witnesses.
p333_215|This is a foolish idea.
p333_216|It separates the men from the boys.
p333_217|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p333_218|Or some thought that they have.
p333_219|If only we had known.
p333_220|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p333_221|A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
p333_222|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p333_223|Two and a half million people have died.
p333_224|It could not be too high.
p333_225|How many cases have there been?
p333_226|I hope they understand that.
p333_227|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p333_228|But Annika is just amazing.
p333_229|Our job is to change that.
p333_230|She will also get a pay rise.
p333_231|It's because they can't understand the language.
p333_232|It is time for a more honest approach.
p333_233|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
p333_234|Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
p333_235|What's it all about?
p333_236|It is a big time for me.
p333_237|There were two things going on at once.
p333_238|It's something we want to make work.
p333_239|I want to play at the highest level.
p333_240|We are all equal.
p333_241|That is the key message.
p333_242|It ignores the future.
p333_243|This is the subway.
p333_244|Altman has every right to be bitter.
p333_245|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p333_246|We were hopeful that it would be successful.
p333_247|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p333_248|It is a weakness, and not the only one.
p333_249|He's in with the furniture.
p333_250|There are two games to go after that.
p333_251|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p333_252|Who will provide the wine?
p333_253|We are still getting signals.
p333_254|What's it got to do with them, anyway?
p333_255|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p333_256|We started from scratch.
p333_257|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p333_258|There are a few changes.
p333_259|You're not going to get hurt.
p333_260|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p333_261|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p333_262|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p333_263|I heard some of his remarks.
p333_264|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p333_265|It has to be funded.
p333_266|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p333_267|I was just overwhelmed.
p333_268|It had been in place since last July.
p333_269|It was very frightened and dirty.
p333_270|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p333_271|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p333_272|That's a very strong element.
p333_273|How much of a cop out is that?
p333_274|The whole region is in shock.
p333_275|It was a journey into a new life.
p333_276|It's a way of making a mark.
p333_277|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p333_278|You were the kidnappers.
p333_279|It is a very interesting subject.
p333_280|We know we can't rely on you.
p333_281|Arguably, they have already done it.
p333_282|It was indeed a night to remember.
p333_283|It doesn't appear to be anything too serious.
p333_284|There is something in this.
p333_285|I could feel the blood on my face.
p333_286|That's why he plays for Scotland.
p333_287|There are no plans to change this.
p333_288|It's too big a risk to take.
p333_289|It's going to be quite a challenge.
p333_290|I have heard the stories from Scotland.
p333_291|It is just too long since the war.
p333_292|My wife is totally behind me on this.
p333_293|Debbie Harry was cool.
p333_294|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p333_295|We are the British National Party, not the English National Party.
p333_296|That sort of thing is long gone.
p333_297|And sooner than we may think.
p333_298|Raised the way you want it.
p333_299|However, consumers may take a different view.
p333_300|I know you went back this morning.
p333_301|I will carry on.
p333_302|A review of the decision is being sought.
p333_303|I made a mistake.
p333_304|It is a very special city.
p333_305|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p333_306|They certainly do not socialise.
p333_307|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p333_308|I think that could work to our advantage.
p333_309|Was that not awful?
p333_310|That was him under pressure.
p333_311|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p333_312|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p333_313|I'm not blaming audiences.
p333_315|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p333_316|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p333_317|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p333_318|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p333_319|I was doing well at the hustings.
p333_320|We will just get on with it.
p333_321|We are worried about casualties.
p333_322|This is my music.
p333_323|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p333_324|I haven't won the world title.
p333_325|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p333_326|It's fantastic to have finally won.
p333_327|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p333_328|And now he tells us.
p333_329|I am not changing my event.
p333_330|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p333_331|This Patton will also return.
p333_332|That is as it may be.
p333_333|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p333_334|He came in an army uniform.
p333_335|Eleven events are required.
p333_336|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p333_337|You encourage them - you can do it.
p333_338|The winner will be announced by early summer.
p333_339|I always said No.
p333_340|The stadium was full.
p333_341|Cinema is a communal experience.
p333_342|So, how will it be received in the US?
p333_343|He was different from the rest of us.
p333_344|His name is Michael Owen.
p333_345|He's got a great chance of making it.
p333_346|Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
p333_347|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p333_348|So now you know.
p333_349|But, at the same time, they made you think about life.
p333_350|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p333_351|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p333_352|The feeling is awesome.
p333_353|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p333_354|Smith has not let him down.
p333_355|We have obviously got some work to do.
p333_356|Which he can do.
p333_357|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p333_358|It has been recorded twice.
p333_359|They were that poor.
p333_360|And we're talking Big Money.
p333_361|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p333_362|They have two children.
p333_363|With Pierre, you can never be sure.
p333_364|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p333_365|I'm really proud of my young players.
p333_366|People buy everything with cash.
p333_367|There was a great support all round the route.
p333_368|They should feel ashamed.
p333_369|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p333_370|Both managements are very supportive.
p333_371|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p333_372|I'll go out and be aggressive.
p333_373|This is important for two reasons.
p333_374|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p333_375|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p333_376|You will not feel a thing.
p333_377|It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
p333_378|It's not just for classical music.
p333_379|This must be kept in total perspective.
p333_380|All of the names are familiar to me.
p333_381|There are moments of honesty, too.
p333_382|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p333_383|Is that where we are?
p333_384|We used to keep our business rates.
p333_385|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p333_386|But there's no eye contact.
p333_387|There was no energy behind it.
p333_388|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p333_389|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p333_390|We have chosen for the patients.
p333_391|They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
p333_392|It is not a wish list.
p333_393|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p333_394|If not, he should go home.
p333_395|There is no margin for error.
p333_396|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
p333_397|I get very excited by that.
p333_398|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
p333_399|In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
p333_400|Which means it matters.
p333_401|I think it can count against you now.
p333_402|There is a great potential on this river.
p333_403|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p333_404|She said he showed no remorse.
p334_001|Please call Stella.
p334_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p334_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p334_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p334_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p334_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p334_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p334_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p334_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p334_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p334_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p334_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p334_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p334_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p334_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p334_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p334_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p334_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p334_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p334_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p334_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p334_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p334_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p334_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p334_025|A judicial review is also being considered.
p334_026|I want to win this thing.
p334_027|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p334_028|I'd just like to play.
p334_029|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p334_030|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p334_031|It was no surprise.
p334_032|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p334_033|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p334_034|Appointed general secretary last September.
p334_035|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p334_036|We could feel the heat.
p334_037|Darrell was, however, adamant.
p334_038|He was a member of the Tartan Army.
p334_039|I think it can count against you now.
p334_040|I wanted to win so badly.
p334_041|It was an accounting error.
p334_042|I had enough on.
p334_043|The offer of help is there for anyone.
p334_044|There were no passengers on board.
p334_045|And we're not there yet.
p334_046|No meaningful response was issued.
p334_047|And the funny thing is, they usually do.
p334_048|Times have changed, but have they improved?
p334_049|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p334_050|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p334_051|Later we discovered it was a hoax.
p334_052|It is a form of physical exercise.
p334_053|plays in dark blue.
p334_054|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
p334_055|It is something that we will put right.
p334_056|Why do it?
p334_057|It could take three days.
p334_058|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p334_059|It was totally my fault.
p334_060|Or so everyone believed.
p334_061|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p334_062|Perhaps we should do the same.
p334_063|Tomorrow night is the important game.
p334_064|He's very good at relating to adults.
p334_065|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p334_066|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p334_067|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p334_068|It was a move which appealed to him.
p334_069|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p334_070|He will need that machine.
p334_071|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
p334_072|We are looking for volunteers.
p334_073|I had a sense of deja vu.
p334_074|It was very personal and very intimate.
p334_075|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p334_076|I was inspired by two things.
p334_077|They follow him everywhere.
p334_078|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p334_079|Maybe that was the whole point.
p334_080|The feeling between the two men was mutual.
p334_081|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p334_082|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
p334_083|This must be really short of ideas.
p334_084|It was extremely cold.
p334_085|They use them for everything.
p334_086|We have the easy part.
p334_087|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
p334_088|They will pass it on to Jim Wallace, the justice minister.
p334_089|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p334_090|Mr Miller is married with three children.
p334_091|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p334_092|We already have them, all over Europe.
p334_093|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p334_094|Libya is an easy target.
p334_095|I thought they played very well.
p334_096|It was a foolhardy decision.
p334_097|It means they actually control the programme.
p334_098|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p334_099|They chose to side with terror.
p334_100|Justice was not seen today.
p334_101|I would never even consider it.
p334_102|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p334_103|We should just say no.
p334_104|We are not out of touch with politics.
p334_105|That was a gold medal for certain.
p334_106|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p334_107|I didn't make those adjustments.
p334_108|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p334_109|We have it on video.
p334_110|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p334_111|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p334_112|It didn't take long.
p334_113|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p334_114|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p334_115|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p334_116|If you're going to do it, do it right.
p334_117|He told the conference.
p334_118|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p334_119|We tend to come good at the end.
p334_120|He also received a medal of honour.
p334_121|It's not one for the purist.
p334_122|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p334_123|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p334_124|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
p334_125|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p334_126|It is a time bomb.
p334_127|It's a matter of huge concern.
p334_128|This could be a recipe for conflict.
p334_129|We are taking advice on this.
p334_130|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p334_131|It was just an accident of birth.
p334_132|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p334_133|It was a simple question.
p334_134|Some of his family still live there.
p334_135|I've no doubt about it, it was actually from her.
p334_136|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p334_137|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p334_138|Could you put it in writing?
p334_139|This is the New Edinburgh.
p334_140|We all thought we were going to die.
p334_141|And that's good news for the magpies.
p334_142|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p334_143|Our offer will remain on the table.
p334_144|The world is split into two.
p334_145|They deserve a lot of credit.
p334_146|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p334_147|It was so physical.
p334_148|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p334_149|He always has been, since his early days with the Scottish Opera.
p334_150|Why is that?
p334_151|It is extremely sad.
p334_153|Europe is a hugely contentious issue.
p334_154|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p334_155|And therein lies the whole problem.
p334_156|He was not deterred.
p334_157|This commitment should be built upon.
p334_158|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
p334_159|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p334_160|That is not just my personal view.
p334_161|The investment will be in the food.
p334_162|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p334_163|The problem is the pitch.
p334_164|That's as it should be.
p334_165|It does seem a mystery.
p334_166|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p334_167|He looked very sharp.
p334_168|The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
p334_169|Two of the team became ill.
p334_170|We have taken steps to rectify it.
p334_171|I see no need for change.
p334_172|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p334_173|But the Premiership is everything to us.
p334_174|Do yourselves a favour.
p334_175|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p334_176|But we have come under attack.
p334_177|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p334_178|What do they do, anyway?
p334_179|He was just like a godfather to it.
p334_180|I'd love to be like Peter.
p334_181|I disagree entirely with the decision.
p334_182|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p334_183|That is his attitude to things.
p334_184|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p334_185|And what was that like, as an experience?
p334_186|Thirteen people will be made redundant.
p334_187|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p334_188|No finals are to be contested today.
p334_189|This is not a struggle against Islam.
p334_190|That night was a terrible muddle.
p334_191|His English counterpart agreed.
p334_192|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p334_193|It is in our own hands.
p334_194|This is a step backwards.
p334_195|We may make a short-term appointment.
p334_196|He will address the nation this evening.
p334_197|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p334_198|I'm not changing my mind.
p334_199|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p334_200|We believe that the reason is poverty.
p334_201|Tony Blair is obviously panicking.
p334_202|We welcome this increase in the minimum wage.
p334_203|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
p334_204|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p334_205|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p334_206|We'll have to work hard today.
p334_207|The frustration was showing.
p334_208|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p334_209|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p334_210|You have obviously got an answer to it.
p334_211|My friends were very envious.
p334_212|But who cares?
p334_213|The house was full of smoke.
p334_214|The approval system will be changed.
p334_215|So the European elections are extremely important.
p334_216|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p334_217|That period was a struggle.
p334_218|We are determined to establish the facts.
p334_219|You just have to accept.
p334_220|We must improve our relations with government.
p334_221|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p334_222|The list is too long for this piece.
p334_223|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p334_224|I can't blame the fans.
p334_225|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p334_226|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
p334_227|But that attachment took a lot of growing.
p334_228|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
p334_229|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p334_230|So far they have refused.
p334_231|He is adamant that he is innocent.
p334_232|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p334_233|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p334_234|He took my breath away.
p334_235|It's good fun, and makes it so much more interesting.
p334_236|I will have to order its destruction.
p334_237|After that it is up to the boss.
p334_238|I never wanted a legal battle.
p334_239|This influence, to the audience, is like an arrow.
p334_240|Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
p334_241|It had won an investors in people award.
p334_242|A venue was found.
p334_243|They are not an item.
p334_244|Basically, the classical tradition won out.
p334_245|Is that Titanic?
p334_246|He was to get his chance.
p334_247|So, the question is, is it any good?
p334_248|I'll always remember the horrible images.
p334_249|That's why they go to the opera.
p334_250|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p334_251|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p334_252|The trouble is, though,there is no simple solution.
p334_253|I'm getting back up there now.
p334_254|Check that he is dead.
p334_255|I couldn't see any reason not to die.
p334_256|My players have no idea about football.
p334_257|They are there to get people into work.
p334_258|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p334_259|I am getting long in the tooth.
p334_260|They would be wise to do just that.
p334_261|He was sentenced to seven years.
p334_262|That, he claimed, was essential.
p334_263|I would like Glasgow.
p334_264|Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
p334_265|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p334_266|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p334_267|The weaknesses are few.
p334_268|I may think about performing it.
p334_269|I would recommend it.
p334_270|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p334_271|Charles Gordon, leader of the Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p334_272|She'd gone to the Catholic school.
p334_273|Where was their passion, the power and feeling?
p334_274|You can't go back and change things.
p334_275|We are on a four-year mission.
p334_276|This is a lie.
p334_277|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
p334_278|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p334_279|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
p334_280|They should stop the bombing.
p334_281|They'll have to pay more.
p334_282|Military chiefs were playing it straight.
p334_283|Does it, Noel?
p334_284|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p334_285|I will never manage another Scottish club.
p334_286|The Open champion is back.
p334_287|It's going to be a new challenge.
p334_288|It's the taking part that counts.
p334_289|They married in August last year.
p334_290|I want to keep him.
p334_291|We haven't actually considered it down here.
p334_292|You've been a great audience.
p334_293|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p334_294|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p334_295|We were given a warm and friendly reception.
p334_296|He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
p334_297|We have been extremely lucky this time.
p334_298|People are fed up.
p334_299|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p334_300|It's a sign of the times.
p334_301|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p334_302|I just need a bit of luck.
p334_303|Once we have done that, the tender will be put out.
p334_304|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p334_305|He is a Satan.
p334_306|I always felt they played for me.
p334_307|If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.
p334_308|They must be kept on the ground.
p334_309|Again, it's about responding to your resources.
p334_310|However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
p334_311|The whole nation will be delighted.
p334_312|The public have been very supportive.
p334_313|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
p334_314|No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
p334_315|The hotel was now for sale.
p334_316|There are two games to go after that.
p334_317|It seems a little short to me.
p334_318|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p334_319|It's ahead of Labour.
p334_320|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
p334_321|I welcome this new service.
p334_322|Then it developed into civil and criminal.
p334_323|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
p334_324|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p334_325|It was a UK-wide report.
p334_326|The law should be changed.
p334_327|This is a dreadful day for Iona.
p334_328|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
p334_329|I will be standing.
p334_330|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p334_331|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p334_332|Are you from the rugby?
p334_333|The attack was totally unprovoked.
p334_334|The plot is simple.
p334_335|They've not let anyone into the loop.
p334_336|So just what is her enduring appeal?
p334_337|With actors it is slightly different.
p334_338|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p334_339|Last night was a key episode.
p334_340|What did we learn?
p334_341|Looking at him is proof of the pudding.
p334_342|I knew he was dying.
p334_343|He's a key player in Scotland.
p334_344|He loved his children.
p334_345|She wondered why we were interested.
p334_346|The story was being repeated across Scotland.
p334_347|An appeal was made to the presiding officer.
p334_348|I am content with the silver.
p334_349|People acted too quickly.
p334_350|This, too, could provoke a risky business.
p334_351|We took the chances when they came.
p334_352|You have to audition for jobs.
p334_353|What would you do if you didn't work?
p334_354|Ferguson should take note.
p334_355|We have always been, and remain confident of the securing of order.
p334_356|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p334_357|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p334_358|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p334_359|It gave no further details.
p334_360|This man is serious about his work.
p334_361|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p334_362|She was released from hospital yesterday.
p334_363|Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
p334_364|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p334_365|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p334_366|We will miss him very much.
p334_367|This was a chilling echo.
p334_368|As a nation, we must become more active.
p334_369|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p334_370|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p334_371|January is a bad time of year.
p334_372|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p334_373|Liberal Democrat leader makes the hash of it.
p334_374|They are a very powerful and tasty side.
p334_375|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p334_376|I'm delighted for Simon.
p334_377|His third goal was superb.
p334_378|Here we have not had one hour.
p334_379|He said to me, Which one, son?
p334_380|I don't have a problem with getting older.
p334_381|His son is a local legend.
p334_382|I was so nervous.
p334_383|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p334_384|His death was a tragic accident.
p334_385|It's to do with context.
p334_386|This fight is not going to go away.
p334_387|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
p334_388|I just don't know where he is.
p334_389|Would you take them?
p334_390|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p334_391|Golf is an expensive game for beginners.
p334_392|He would take up the bike.
p334_393|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p334_394|He sat down at the piano.
p334_395|His condition was stable last night.
p334_396|The sun is worth a million dollars.
p334_397|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p334_398|I'm sure they love it.
p334_399|I'd never seen a play about me.
p334_400|The track is currently covered in snow.
p334_401|And they all had these other commitments.
p334_402|The report is due out next month.
p334_403|It was nerve-racking to watch.
p334_404|We are going to change our party.
p335_001|Please call Stella.
p335_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p335_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p335_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p335_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p335_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p335_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p335_008|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p335_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p335_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p335_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p335_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p335_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p335_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p335_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p335_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p335_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p335_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p335_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p335_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p335_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p335_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p335_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p335_025|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
p335_026|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p335_027|I believe in the Church.
p335_028|Let's not go overboard.
p335_029|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p335_030|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p335_031|It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.
p335_032|Well, what do you know?
p335_033|But she was very human.
p335_034|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p335_035|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p335_036|Pupils and staff were sent home early.
p335_037|There were no proposals on the table.
p335_038|Who does he think will win?
p335_039|He will emerge as a world leader.
p335_040|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p335_041|I only half believed it.
p335_042|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p335_043|All the oil companies are talking together.
p335_044|The failings are serious.
p335_045|The prognosis is excellent.
p335_046|Rangers deserved to beat us.
p335_047|That, though, is the measure of the man.
p335_048|On reflection, it is more than that.
p335_049|It is not normal practice.
p335_050|But he just carried on anyway.
p335_051|They couldn't believe what had happened.
p335_052|I would not want to be young again.
p335_053|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p335_054|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p335_055|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p335_056|I don't want to hear any excuses.
p335_057|They were later discharged from hospital.
p335_058|Let's see that increase over the years.
p335_059|I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
p335_060|These findings would be made public.
p335_061|It's the most beautiful place on earth.
p335_062|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
p335_063|I've learned from my mistakes.
p335_064|This must be wrong.
p335_065|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
p335_066|It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
p335_067|I go home only once.
p335_068|I am delighted to hear this wonderful news.
p335_069|It is a family day out.
p335_070|On that basis, he would set it aside.
p335_071|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p335_072|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
p335_073|Seven people were later detained by police.
p335_074|The team this year is going places.
p335_075|We should do everything at a stroke.
p335_076|He had a moustache.
p335_077|It's just for me.
p335_078|History is usually written by the victors.
p335_079|It plans to return to this field.
p335_080|He said because people had invited him.
p335_081|That would be dangerous.
p335_082|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
p335_083|We aim to put them out of business.
p335_084|They're completely different from each other.
p335_085|He was extremely nervous.
p335_086|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p335_087|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p335_088|I came up through the ranks.
p335_089|We still don't know what's happened.
p335_090|His team management was protective.
p335_091|The proposal was rejected.
p335_092|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p335_093|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p335_094|Four other charges were dropped.
p335_095|These guys will not lie down.
p335_096|I would think they are just behind them.
p335_097|You can expect a hell of a fuss.
p335_098|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p335_099|That is nearly four people every day.
p335_100|There are nine people here now.
p335_101|I like what has happened!
p335_102|This would not be my first choice.
p335_103|We knew nothing about it.
p335_104|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p335_105|Which perhaps is just as well.
p335_106|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p335_107|They receive a high profile in the media.
p335_108|They have got their position, we have got our position.
p335_109|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p335_110|Or was it?
p335_111|It is not fair.
p335_112|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p335_113|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
p335_114|The dealer is on notice.
p335_115|But it will backfire.
p335_116|We kept going right to the final whistle.
p335_117|Police were also perplexed.
p335_118|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p335_119|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p335_120|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p335_121|The final stage is paranoia.
p335_122|I am not holding the club to ransom.
p335_123|Wagner was never like this.
p335_124|The plane was in flames
p335_125|We represent a wide range of society.
p335_126|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p335_127|I've seen some of the submissions.
p335_128|It was meant to rival the dollar.
p335_129|A win was a real achievement.
p335_130|This is the high point of my career.
p335_131|That's the sort of game you want.
p335_132|My duty is to win.
p335_133|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p335_134|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p335_135|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p335_136|Suddenly, directing was the thing he wanted to do.
p335_137|I am prepared to help make it happen.
p335_138|This is not presently the case.
p335_139|It was a moment of madness.
p335_140|Don't even bother applying.
p335_141|We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
p335_142|I do not own the vessel in question.
p335_143|Racism has no place in any sport.
p335_144|It's all too short term.
p335_145|It's too big a risk to take.
p335_146|Mummy believed in one thing above all.
p335_147|It was worth a photograph.
p335_148|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p335_149|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p335_150|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p335_151|I'd say we should give it a week.
p335_152|The elections should have no role in this.
p335_153|There was a lot of resentment.
p335_154|Where is the anthrax?
p335_155|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
p335_156|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p335_157|It's because they can't understand the language.
p335_158|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p335_159|He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
p335_160|This is good news for the Western Isles.
p335_161|It's been a good year.
p335_162|We've got the top three.
p335_163|But the price has been very high.
p335_164|I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
p335_165|That nation is South Africa.
p335_166|This will secure the future of our industry.
p335_167|It's just a normal life.
p335_168|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p335_169|Where is the structure?
p335_170|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p335_171|There's still time for that.
p335_172|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p335_173|He is the example for all of us.
p335_174|It was an empowering journey.
p335_175|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p335_176|Laura is an investment banker.
p335_177|Teams are always interesting to watch.
p335_178|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
p335_179|They had been together for about three years.
p335_180|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p335_181|Our customers come first.
p335_182|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
p335_183|Whether this return was too soon.
p335_184|We didn't think anything would happen.
p335_185|He had come of age.
p335_186|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
p335_187|We do things in an appropriate way.
p335_188|We just want to get stuck in now.
p335_189|Do you come from Moscow?
p335_190|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p335_191|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
p335_192|That wasn't for me.
p335_193|I am delighted with today's win.
p335_194|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p335_195|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p335_196|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p335_197|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p335_198|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
p335_199|There we were on the first tee.
p335_200|Next time around, it will be different.
p335_201|Broke the birdie record.
p335_202|I looked forward to it.
p335_203|That is a brand name.
p335_204|She was an only child.
p335_205|It is best value.
p335_206|The text is reduced to bubbles.
p335_207|They should come forward.
p335_208|We don't say there was a massacre.
p335_209|That has not changed.
p335_210|John Lennon is a very large industry.
p335_211|The island will never recover.
p335_212|We are not ruling it out.
p335_213|You saw the pain he was in.
p335_214|That is not an easy thing.
p335_215|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p335_216|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
p335_217|This doesn't have to be our future.
p335_218|It is a court case.
p335_219|She was a delightful person.
p335_220|They will have to make changes.
p335_221|The next one comes up.
p335_222|This fact is supported by audience research.
p335_223|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p335_224|We have great sympathy with Danny.
p335_225|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
p335_226|Both sides have to step back.
p335_227|This is wonderful news.
p335_228|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p335_229|But if they were there, they were keeping a low profile.
p335_230|It shows that painting is still relevant.
p335_231|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p335_232|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
p335_233|We are ready for the long haul.
p335_234|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p335_235|This is a big step up.
p335_236|I don't have any answer for them.
p335_237|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p335_238|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p335_239|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p335_240|EMI is a prime example.
p335_241|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p335_242|You cannot allow it to go on.
p335_243|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p335_244|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p335_245|A friendship that will endure.
p335_246|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p335_247|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p335_248|I am deeply sorry they did.
p335_249|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p335_250|Alex is a big part of that future.
p335_251|Who would have thought it?
p335_252|I think he was surprised.
p335_253|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p335_254|Finally action had been taken.
p335_255|Then there's the problem of sympathy.
p335_256|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p335_257|That gives us a bit of a chance.
p335_258|I watched a game.
p335_259|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p335_260|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p335_261|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p335_262|Intensive care has been very busy.
p335_263|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p335_264|I try not to expect anything.
p335_265|This is my home town.
p335_266|I think we've got the balance right.
p335_267|We will build upon the basic state pension.
p335_268|I have good memories of Glasgow.
p335_269|Nothing can bring back their son.
p335_270|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p335_271|Some may end up in hospital.
p335_272|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p335_273|The council has been open and transparent.
p335_274|We can do nothing about that.
p335_275|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p335_276|That is highly unfair.
p335_277|There is great demand for human cloning.
p335_278|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
p335_279|Or rather he did and he didn't.
p335_280|Scots actors should be so lucky.
p335_281|Government sources said, It is building up.
p335_282|Arsenal considered the job done.
p335_283|I think it will make a huge difference.
p335_284|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p335_285|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p335_286|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p335_287|Others were even less confident.
p335_288|I just want to change my life.
p335_289|On occasions he succeeded.
p335_290|He did not oppose the divorce.
p335_291|Famously, though, there was a catch.
p335_292|There are so many people to thank.
p335_293|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p335_294|He is also a great finisher.
p335_295|He knew it would cost him millions.
p335_296|I'd never be free.
p335_297|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p335_298|A counter reaction was.
p335_299|He said he was sorry.
p335_300|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p335_301|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
p335_302|This will help our confidence.
p335_303|This looks like it is anything but open.
p335_304|We are now setting about finding them.
p335_305|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p335_306|If not, he should go home.
p335_307|We must not go down that road.
p335_308|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p335_309|Luckily for us, he enjoyed the experience.
p335_310|I am not among its admirers.
p335_311|Hitches can be expected.
p335_312|He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
p335_313|The issues are very intense.
p335_314|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p335_315|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p335_316|The company's in good shape.
p335_317|Dialogue is the key.
p335_318|The actors are confident and polished.
p335_319|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p335_320|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p335_321|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p335_322|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p335_323|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p335_324|You have to think not.
p335_325|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p335_326|This is a national crisis.
p335_327|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p335_328|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p335_329|In Europe, it is always over two games.
p335_330|The whole thing would be perfect.
p335_331|There's a tremendous amount of adventure.
p335_332|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p335_333|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p335_334|However, we had no failures in our side.
p335_335|I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.
p335_336|We will be stronger in Berlin.
p335_337|It is so damaging.
p335_338|I put pressure on him.
p335_339|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p335_340|I'm the one who has to suffer.
p335_341|With us, we just want them to respond.
p335_342|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
p335_343|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p335_344|They are the heroes.
p335_345|The songs are just so good.
p335_346|We have rebuilt and reformed.
p335_347|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p335_348|It was certainly intense.
p335_349|It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.
p335_350|He refused to discuss his imminent retiral.
p335_351|He denied that taxpayers money was involved.
p335_352|We were a shambles at the back.
p335_353|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p335_354|It took more than two years.
p335_355|There is access for disabled people.
p335_356|The home was now under new management.
p335_357|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
p335_358|Is my wife a racist?
p335_359|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p335_360|There is no openness.
p335_361|It's being very carefully looked at.
p335_362|It feels like too much.
p335_363|It was a job he loved.
p335_364|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p335_365|But let's not get carried away.
p335_366|There was some merit in that.
p335_367|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p335_368|Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
p335_369|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p335_370|It looks like paradise.
p335_371|This means a great deal to the families.
p335_372|At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
p335_373|We were short of athletes.
p335_374|Six other people were injured.
p335_375|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p335_376|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p335_377|Only local people are helping.
p335_378|There were three boys and two girls.
p335_379|There's no support for it at all.
p335_380|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p335_381|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p335_382|Writing has diminished in value.
p335_383|There is a job to be done.
p335_384|Scotland is too small a country for that.
p335_385|I am not obsessed with sex.
p335_386|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p335_387|It's our worst nightmare.
p335_388|I can't believe what has happened.
p335_389|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p335_390|It's really nothing new.
p335_391|You do that because you want to win.
p335_392|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
p335_393|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
p335_394|Partition is not an option.
p335_395|We have been treated with complete contempt.
p335_396|I'll tell you honestly.
p335_397|The home team had an amazing start.
p335_398|He became the focus of surrounding interest.
p335_399|It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.
p335_400|The conclusion is enthralling.
p335_401|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p335_402|The review has been conducted fairly.
p335_403|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p335_404|Friends of the family have given their support.
p336_001|Please call Stella.
p336_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p336_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p336_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p336_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p336_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p336_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p336_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p336_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p336_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p336_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p336_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p336_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p336_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p336_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p336_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p336_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p336_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p336_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p336_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p336_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p336_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p336_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed forms yellow.
p336_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p336_025|I am very happy with the result.
p336_026|She took them for a term.
p336_027|It is deeply worrying.
p336_028|This is a very interesting move.
p336_029|Are we not men?
p336_030|How could it not?
p336_031|It is sending the wrong message to people.
p336_032|Another former manager, Bobby Robson said.
p336_033|We are proud of them.
p336_034|We had a really good experience with David.
p336_035|It was another good idea.
p336_036|I want to make a vigorous defence.
p336_037|That incident altered the pattern of the game.
p336_038|IT is a terrible equation.
p336_039|That gives us something to kick against.
p336_040|It was pretty special.
p336_041|Whatever we are doing, they have good reason to come.
p336_042|I should say so.
p336_043|Yet therein is the problem.
p336_044|This isn't a new problem.
p336_045|That, though, was just the start of it.
p336_046|My office is down there.
p336_047|There can be no dispute about our history.
p336_048|The crowd was waiting.
p336_049|It was a joy.
p336_050|It's the same with cinema.
p336_051|It was the climax of the thing.
p336_052|He died from multiple injuries.
p336_053|It is nearly there.
p336_054|I'm going to buy a car.
p336_055|We said, What do you mean?
p336_056|I have been there many times.
p336_057|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p336_058|This ruling is a farce.
p336_059|They enjoy playing the game.
p336_060|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
p336_061|It is not standing army.
p336_062|It was a crucial moment.
p336_063|Someone else has now got them.
p336_064|The second is freedom.
p336_065|I let go the telephone and ran.
p336_066|Get used to it.
p336_067|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
p336_068|Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
p336_069|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
p336_070|Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
p336_071|The hearing was continued until a later date.
p336_072|Still, some additions are inspired.
p336_073|Any error is severely punished.
p336_074|Yet what is supposed to be said?
p336_075|But we will learn from that.
p336_076|He has not created a Festival resource.
p336_077|We couldn't afford it.
p336_078|I get the bus.
p336_079|I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.
p336_080|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p336_081|The issues are not going to change.
p336_082|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p336_083|Would you have ever believed that was possible?
p336_084|It will be easier for us.
p336_085|I don't think it is.
p336_086|There are no other contenders.
p336_087|On that they agree.
p336_088|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p336_089|But who was driving it?
p336_090|We have to get this sorted out.
p336_091|It was very fast.
p336_092|Singing is my first love.
p336_093|When is it ever anything else?
p336_094|It's hard to see it.
p336_095|I believe in trade unions.
p336_096|Sub Not Used, Mackay.
p336_097|This is in a league of its own.
p336_098|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p336_099|That statement has never been withdrawn.
p336_100|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p336_101|That is unlikely to happen.
p336_102|That is a mark of what you are.
p336_103|This is not finished.
p336_104|It was one of the firemen.
p336_105|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p336_106|Don't you believe it.
p336_107|There is another important factor.
p336_108|Most people know that.
p336_109|I want to keep playing.
p336_110|At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
p336_111|The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.
p336_112|That is how we will be judged.
p336_113|It's there for people to look at.
p336_114|We are getting there.
p336_115|I just couldn't believe what had happened.
p336_116|They never got into the show this time.
p336_117|He, too, is keen to redress the balance.
p336_118|But no, it's not funny.
p336_119|We just try to make great records.
p336_120|It's almost certainly not going to help.
p336_121|Why does it come out now?
p336_122|In that case, the children were not missing.
p336_123|These figures are truly awful.
p336_124|The whole thing was just unreal.
p336_125|They haven't been thought through.
p336_126|They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
p336_127|It's better than that, it's fantastic.
p336_128|The criteria have changed.
p336_129|Everyone in front of me was dead.
p336_130|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p336_131|I have thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p336_132|I just have no maternal instincts.
p336_133|It has been declared.
p336_134|His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.
p336_135|Clearly, audiences are unsettled.
p336_136|It's very hard to plan for it.
p336_137|There is nothing like this back home.
p336_138|They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
p336_139|He is that good.
p336_140|We did not have a clue.
p336_141|We need to be more specific.
p336_142|This is the man who provides the hope.
p336_143|This is a war over our home.
p336_144|He's got me very well.
p336_145|He has been banned from the Salmon Inn.
p336_146|He was always nice to me.
p336_147|He looked at me before replying.
p336_148|Then there is the Mini itself.
p336_149|This may be perfectly innocent.
p336_150|It's good for the city.
p336_151|The only answer is a public inquiry.
p336_152|Controllers major concern is safety.
p336_153|It's like an extension of your body.
p336_154|Because he usually is.
p336_155|It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
p336_156|We have waited a long time for this.
p336_157|I want my audience to be challenged.
p336_158|This is the culture change in medicine.
p336_159|Who do you think you are?
p336_160|Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
p336_161|I have no battle with the Scots.
p336_162|I hope he gets it.
p336_163|Everything has its place and purpose.
p336_164|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p336_165|I am here to work for Scottish Labour.
p336_166|Nobody could survive on that.
p336_167|I can't do anything before nine.
p336_168|Their vision was not impeded.
p336_169|He is married with three children.
p336_170|These days will be back.
p336_171|However, they should not come as a surprise.
p336_172|It could last five months.
p336_173|Everything is accounted for.
p336_174|The support from the general public was astounding.
p336_175|About time too, you might think.
p336_176|However, it does not tell the full story.
p336_177|We have made mistakes and were badly punished.
p336_178|The bombing has had a huge influence.
p336_179|We've got a mixture of both.
p336_180|I'm very happy to be here.
p336_181|This is not the case.
p336_182|This one was supposed to be so different.
p336_183|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p336_184|It has been difficult for her to do, he says.
p336_185|They are now out in the cold.
p336_186|However, planners should be taking the lead.
p336_187|Cloning is not ready.
p336_188|New Labour are running scared.
p336_189|It is a good result for Great Britain.
p336_190|The weekly average was three hours.
p336_191|Is there a new way forward?
p336_192|Don't hold your breath!
p336_193|This is the start of a slippery slope.
p336_194|Where do you think she is going?
p336_195|Safety is our first concern.
p336_196|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
p336_197|Inspections are not the problem.
p336_198|But who will buy it?
p336_199|And it's more subversive.
p336_200|Openness is always the best way.
p336_201|It wouldn't go off.
p336_202|I've been enjoying it, though.
p336_203|The professor said the results were positive.
p336_204|I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
p336_205|It's part of the end game.
p336_206|Do they play for the money?
p336_207|The train was on time.
p336_208|So, where do we go from here?
p336_209|The claim was denied by the first minister.
p336_210|More than that, it's a vicious circle.
p336_211|And how much of a compliment is that?
p336_213|Politics is a tough game.
p336_214|I have friends in Glasgow.
p336_215|What has changed?
p336_216|There's nothing to be gained by it.
p336_217|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p336_218|We have been through this with the lawyers.
p336_219|I'm not interested in the job.
p336_220|His contract was then not renewed.
p336_221|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p336_222|The warnings were a good reminder.
p336_223|I came here this week to work.
p336_224|It's the last thing on my mind.
p336_225|Barry Ferguson is one of them.
p336_226|The biggest resource is our staff.
p336_227|We have big ideas.
p336_228|How will we get there?
p336_229|She told me to stop.
p336_230|I wish him well for the future.
p336_231|Cars are great for going long distances.
p336_232|It's not a party, no, no.
p336_233|The lads are having a tour.
p336_234|It may not be life long.
p336_235|Everyone was in tears.
p336_236|It was just above the roof.
p336_237|These were the dreams.
p336_238|But we must work in harmony.
p336_239|It's a bit like a bereavement.
p336_240|There is no other way.
p336_241|Everyone must be focused on the league.
p336_242|The English are coming.
p336_243|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
p336_244|I believe in theatre.
p336_245|Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
p336_246|It's time to say enough is enough.
p336_247|He has to pull back from the brink.
p336_248|She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
p336_249|I don't have any regrets about the edit.
p336_250|That does not mean we have failed.
p336_251|The family baton is handed on.
p336_252|She has a little boy.
p336_253|Our policy is very clear on this issue.
p336_254|He has refused to do that.
p336_255|I can understand why they have gone.
p336_256|All my training is for Athens.
p336_257|This is a personal decision for me.
p336_258|When will you listen?
p336_259|I'm happy that we have agreed.
p336_260|All of them were killed.
p336_261|All the children on the roll are genuine.
p336_262|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p336_263|You can spend money on housing.
p336_264|Ferguson must take the blame.
p336_265|There is no point in denying that.
p336_266|The kids are paying the price.
p336_267|Not that it is unique.
p336_268|We're all going to take a holiday.
p336_269|I've got three other ideas for the day.
p336_270|Some injustice was committed.
p336_271|I've had a wonderful career.
p336_272|The BBC was a disgrace.
p336_273|I didn't expect to be in.
p336_274|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p336_275|I reckon he won't make the mistake again.
p336_276|I should think so, too.
p336_277|If so, we want to hear from them.
p336_278|It's not covered by the insurance.
p336_279|He denied the charge.
p336_280|I was shaking on the blocks.
p336_281|There is no easy answer.
p336_282|I watch the other visitors.
p336_283|Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
p336_284|I am not a liar.
p336_285|The cause remained a mystery last night.
p336_286|He had no problem with alcohol.
p336_287|I had no experience at all.
p336_288|Yet he remains confident enough.
p336_289|It has become very confused.
p336_290|Fame and money followed.
p336_291|It's a national sport.
p336_292|I just made it.
p336_293|There was no secrecy.
p336_294|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
p336_295|Even then it might be difficult.
p336_296|I can't believe we didn't win that game.
p336_297|Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
p336_299|Relief was beyond belief.
p336_300|Beyond that would have been outrageous.
p336_301|It was complete nonsense.
p336_302|I seem to keep this for the majors.
p336_303|It is three years.
p336_304|They are not always the same person.
p336_305|We meet again in Berlin.
p336_306|This is a very special moment for me.
p336_307|It is a daunting task.
p336_308|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p336_309|We have chosen for the patients.
p336_310|That was me today.
p336_311|That is when we are really effective.
p336_312|They just would not have run away.
p336_313|But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
p336_314|This idea has been around for four years.
p336_315|But he made a mistake in picking it.
p336_316|This is an appealing record.
p336_317|They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
p336_318|Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
p336_319|This is a problem we have to tackle.
p336_320|Yes, it was uplifting.
p336_321|Nobody should believe this story.
p336_322|No person has been charged.
p336_323|One paper was not returned.
p336_324|I don't want to do too much.
p336_325|We don't have money to get to town.
p336_326|We have great support.
p336_327|One would not want to go there anyway.
p336_328|And it's difficult to argue.
p336_329|We'll see what happens.
p336_330|That could be in place by next year.
p336_331|That's not part of the deal.
p336_332|There is a problem.
p336_333|He pretended not to care.
p336_334|They are very concerned, and you can understand that.
p336_335|Not because they want to sing about something.
p336_336|Was it too obvious?
p336_337|Wouldn't it be nice?
p336_338|I was in tears in the street.
p336_339|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
p336_340|It is a terrible thing to have happened.
p336_343|The work was suspended following the kidnap.
p336_344|Fifteen minutes later, they were found.
p336_345|That is why we are here.
p336_346|He wouldn't do it.
p336_347|She becomes a mother.
p336_348|He is very much respected within the group.
p336_349|People want to learn.
p336_350|Bomber was not amused.
p336_351|I am not a happy man.
p336_352|But it was fun.
p336_353|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p336_354|No decisions have been made in this respect.
p336_355|It's been such a waste of money.
p336_356|Not so, it transpires.
p336_357|Things don't look too good at the moment.
p336_358|Inside, there is a kind of madness.
p336_359|I'd like to run.
p336_360|Its future is no longer in question.
p336_361|But this relative success has not been easy.
p336_362|I am a player.
p336_363|I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
p336_364|He was not alone.
p336_365|There was too much at stake.
p336_366|Who wouldn't do it?
p336_368|He was taken to hospital, but later died.
p336_369|Eriksson would have approved.
p336_370|We are all in the frontline.
p336_371|It looked like a war zone.
p336_372|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
p336_373|Further expansion is possible.
p336_374|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p336_375|I'm interested in all kinds of history.
p336_376|At this point we can only speculate.
p336_377|We know we have the quality.
p336_378|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p336_379|It may be the first of many.
p336_380|It runs in cycles.
p336_381|It is already making a difference.
p336_382|I spoke to him yesterday.
p336_383|We are looking very hard at ourselves.
p336_384|This is the stuff of live music.
p336_385|We were beaten by the better team today.
p336_386|Taxes may need to rise.
p336_387|It's unusual to say the least.
p336_388|I was quietly confident about getting the win.
p336_389|I am not going to sit back.
p336_390|But this is even worse.
p336_391|It left me with a sadness.
p336_392|I was living with my mum.
p336_393|The truth is he probably doesn't.
p336_394|There were few surprises.
p336_395|He is a one-off.
p336_396|And then he laughs.
p336_397|She is having an affair with his partner.
p336_398|He put a lot of effort into it.
p336_399|The pressure is enormous.
p336_400|I am not that sadistic.
p336_401|Are you all right?
p336_402|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
p336_403|I'm certainly thinking about retirement.
p339_001|Please call Stella.
p339_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p339_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a sack for her brother Bob.
p339_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p339_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p339_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p339_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p339_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p339_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p339_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p339_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p339_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p339_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p339_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p339_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p339_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p339_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p339_018|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p339_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p339_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p339_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p339_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p339_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p339_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p339_025|They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
p339_026|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p339_027|Glasgow is far from overload.
p339_028|It's a big mystery.
p339_029|What is a house without it?
p339_030|It was really good in the first week.
p339_031|It's about the balance.
p339_032|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p339_033|It really has not been their season.
p339_034|I want somebody with something to prove.
p339_035|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p339_036|There was a ban on reporting the trial.
p339_037|I don't think the action was a mistake.
p339_038|You go in there and do it.
p339_039|We were in Italy  suddenly, we knew.
p339_040|What will happen to them today?
p339_041|I didn't expect to get one.
p339_042|It was electric, amazing.
p339_043|I said to him.
p339_044|Labour has been found out on public spending.
p339_045|he told a producer.
p339_046|That is not the place for her.
p339_047|The jury is still out on this one.
p339_048|We have to work together.
p339_049|I don't think that he won't be released.
p339_050|It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
p339_051|It means it is difficult.
p339_052|But they were true stories.
p339_053|I needed to get away.
p339_054|I will make that point tonight.
p339_055|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p339_056|There are two things we have to do.
p339_057|Are they going to work together again?
p339_058|We need to do that every week.
p339_059|It gives us something to work on.
p339_060|But what did it matter?
p339_061|A government is a government is a government.
p339_062|Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.
p339_063|I am not retaining him.
p339_064|The police are not the target.
p339_065|It has affected it, obviously.
p339_066|But that title is a mistake.
p339_067|And he's not a bigot.
p339_068|But summer is spent.
p339_069|Services are being expanded, too.
p339_070|It has only been rumours.
p339_071|It is extremely fortunate.
p339_072|Today is the first step in that process.
p339_073|Several others were absent.
p339_074|It is surprising to come back this way.
p339_075|But there was no time for that.
p339_076|A review is under way.
p339_077|That should be fun.
p339_078|Maybe he will act again.
p339_079|What we were doing.
p339_080|What is the Barnett formula?
p339_081|It all happened so suddenly.
p339_082|I won't let that happen.
p339_083|Or have they?
p339_084|There is no change in the strategy.
p339_085|I had a fortunate war.
p339_086|It will probably be my last, too.
p339_087|I am not completely insane.
p339_088|We spoke about a few people.
p339_089|She had to learn a new discipline.
p339_090|In fact, he took it very well.
p339_091|I decided to take my time.
p339_092|Quite a lot of people know that, actually.
p339_093|We did it in one take.
p339_094|He doesn't even know who he is.
p339_095|It is hard to understand.
p339_096|What will it be?
p339_097|The search is due to be completed today.
p339_098|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p339_099|What you sow, you have to reap.
p339_100|He is a one-off.
p339_101|Six men will take the decision.
p339_102|To have Mr Clinton is quite an accolade.
p339_103|We should not be surprised at that.
p339_104|It was a disaster.
p339_105|We have been so lucky.
p339_107|It was a bit of a tightrope.
p339_108|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
p339_109|It was all over now.
p339_110|But it was only a matter of time.
p339_111|I always liked to get a laugh.
p339_112|I still hope to go.
p339_113|Sometimes they come off.
p339_114|We're not that bad.
p339_115|Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.
p339_116|I feel strongly about it.
p339_117|There are exciting days ahead.
p339_118|We have to put this behind us.
p339_119|I thought it was quite good.
p339_120|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p339_121|We're very, very happy.
p339_122|There could be a possible connection.
p339_123|But there was everything!
p339_124|We are doing very well as we are.
p339_125|The Scots are great.
p339_126|That imbalance was evident in their play.
p339_127|However, the drama was not over.
p339_128|But it was not just the land.
p339_129|I don't think the referees are against us.
p339_130|It is too much for me.
p339_131|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p339_132|We are still waiting.
p339_133|It happened again yesterday.
p339_134|He will be a major challenger next year.
p339_135|That question was never asked.
p339_136|I am not inclined to believe it.
p339_137|It was on fire.
p339_138|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
p339_139|How can they tell?
p339_140|My ambition is to make the cut.
p339_141|It will be for the committee to decide.
p339_142|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p339_143|Rangers must be winners, it says.
p339_144|He was part of the family.
p339_145|I certainly think it should be there.
p339_146|But it does not matter.
p339_147|Hopefully we can put in a performance.
p339_148|Sadly, he has a point.
p339_149|It was so sad.
p339_150|Mind you, all was not lost.
p339_151|We were extremely lucky.
p339_152|It was an amazing time.
p339_153|In fact, the reasons are simple.
p339_154|The hearing is expected to continue today.
p339_155|It is just a matter of time.
p339_156|This news is really depressing.
p339_157|I'm not fit for anything else.
p339_158|The day may come, but not for a while.
p339_159|The enemy was time.
p339_160|He would have done the same to me.
p339_161|What were they told?
p339_162|More cases are expected.
p339_163|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p339_164|It would be very dangerous.
p339_165|How can they say that?
p339_166|My condition is not bad.
p339_167|Tomorrow is a big day for Scotland.
p339_168|I would like to make an impact, of course.
p339_169|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p339_170|The goal is clear.
p339_171|Just think about the lines.
p339_172|It all depends on the wind.
p339_173|I was very influenced by him.
p339_174|I'm so worried about the roads.
p339_175|This was much worse.
p339_176|This was certainly not about money.
p339_177|It is simple, but profound.
p339_178|The funding is now there.
p339_179|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p339_180|A film is different from a book.
p339_181|Within three days he was dead.
p339_182|You'll find out on Saturday.
p339_183|Did they give any good advice?
p339_184|We know that from recent experience.
p339_185|From day one, we were a family.
p339_186|It separates the men from the boys.
p339_187|This could be wonderful.
p339_188|He loved it, and so did they.
p339_189|The other was a football match.
p339_190|They have the players to do it.
p339_191|Which is worse?
p339_192|He has made a step forward.
p339_193|That was very important.
p339_194|This will have to change.
p339_195|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p339_196|It was a very strong metaphor.
p339_197|We are going to have a party.
p339_198|I have no problem with that.
p339_199|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p339_200|I'm very happy that it exploded.
p339_201|We're all paying for it.
p339_202|Lester was like that.
p339_203|Look at New Labour, it hasn't worked.
p339_204|That's a matter for them.
p339_205|We were never told it was already decided.
p339_206|It is part of our heritage.
p339_207|It is not a road of life.
p339_208|It is not as simple as that.
p339_209|Everything in the symphony is there.
p339_210|Find them somebody they deserve.
p339_211|It's a big challenge for the audience.
p339_212|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p339_213|It has certainly paid off for him.
p339_214|We're not getting involved.
p339_215|The lottery has helped.
p339_216|They know the language.
p339_217|The acting left a lot to be desired.
p339_218|We shall be victorious.
p339_219|The quality of work is very impressive.
p339_220|However, he added there were signs of progress.
p339_221|You cannot do that in a lobby.
p339_222|We will all suffer as a result.
p339_223|Without doubt, they can win the title.
p339_224|What's it about?
p339_225|We are looking to the future.
p339_226|The signs are positive.
p339_227|I called it right.
p339_228|I see it as my job.
p339_229|I have always believed in myself.
p339_230|It has to be put in context.
p339_231|I think we can get there.
p339_232|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p339_233|No, they have played well.
p339_234|The reaction of staff has been fantastic.
p339_235|The answer is obviously no.
p339_236|I'll take it as it comes.
p339_237|I think we're the better side.
p339_238|We act because we must.
p339_239|There are two mysteries.
p339_240|The teacher would have approved.
p339_241|Are you going to win?
p339_242|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p339_243|I could have been killed on that day.
p339_244|They have to come up with a solution.
p339_245|It is very enjoyable.
p339_246|Now, that would impress the kids.
p339_247|Did it work?
p339_248|But that is for another day.
p339_249|There is a great carry over value.
p339_250|It was not like that at all.
p339_251|Police are appealing for witnesses.
p339_252|I was very surprised.
p339_253|We all knew they could do it.
p339_254|It's about taking risks.
p339_255|Why is this?
p339_256|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
p339_257|It was indeed a night to remember.
p339_258|There are not too many like him.
p339_259|The memory is there.
p339_260|It was an amazing experience.
p339_261|Nobody has been put on trial.
p339_262|He will go on the bench.
p339_263|The police are hopeless.
p339_264|There are no plans to change this.
p339_265|We are deeply concerned at the announcement.
p339_266|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p339_267|That's the important thing.
p339_268|Should he resign?
p339_269|They have to live with the risk.
p339_270|It is, but that's not the point.
p339_271|It was my whole life.
p339_272|It was a classic.
p339_273|This week is a perfect example.
p339_274|However, it is going to happen.
p339_275|This time it really could happen.
p339_276|That sort of thing is long gone.
p339_277|That includes the equipment?
p339_278|It does nothing for me.
p339_279|That has been lost.
p339_280|But that's another story.
p339_281|I think it has worked.
p339_282|No other family members could be contacted.
p339_283|There is nothing to be gained from that.
p339_284|We're very proud of him and his achievement.
p339_285|But do not rely on it.
p339_286|I made a mistake.
p339_287|What do you want.
p339_288|That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
p339_289|I think we could do well in Europe.
p339_290|And yet, there has been no great impact.
p339_291|Was that not awful?
p339_292|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
p339_293|I'm not there yet but it is close.
p339_294|But it will not work again.
p339_295|Even then he wanted to deflect attention.
p339_296|I have nothing to say on that.
p339_297|The rest is his own.
p339_298|I have no worry about that.
p339_299|There has been a fair bit in between, too.
p339_300|Who was on the panel?
p339_301|It turned out to have been three hours.
p339_302|That is exactly right.
p339_303|That is not good for golf!
p339_304|He had planned to sell it.
p339_305|We know the goals will come.
p339_306|But it did not last.
p339_307|They need to look after themselves.
p339_308|They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
p339_309|She asked for the appointment with me.
p339_310|We have nothing to lose.
p339_311|The first time it was rejected.
p339_312|He did not report it.
p339_313|No-one can take it in.
p339_314|They were following his orders.
p339_315|That is an entirely different discipline.
p339_316|It was an insult.
p339_317|Yet there is hope.
p339_318|Referees in Scotland are very weak.
p339_319|It will not be easy for him.
p339_320|That was a fairy tale.
p339_321|I would love to do that.
p339_322|You'll have to wait and see.
p339_323|It wasn't the issue.
p339_324|The number never came.
p339_325|I really have to go now.
p339_326|We are going to listen to Britain.
p339_327|There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
p339_328|Words are not enough.
p339_329|He is in charge on the pitch.
p339_330|We have expected it.
p339_331|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p339_332|Well, that was the plan.
p339_333|The problem is fairly serious.
p339_334|No decisions have been taken.
p339_335|We won't do that.
p339_336|It's the body that counts.
p339_337|Sprinters are not fit.
p339_338|This has been coming for weeks and weeks.
p339_339|It's a double whammy.
p339_340|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p339_341|Let's not make that mistake again.
p339_342|That's why he is the prime minister.
p339_343|Only injury has prevented that happening before.
p339_344|They have to be dealt with.
p339_345|His manager blamed the referee.
p339_346|So what was he really doing?
p339_347|I don't want to go anywhere.
p339_348|How do we get a bigger stage?
p339_349|We're very close to being a good team.
p339_350|I thought their commitment was superb.
p339_351|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p339_352|My mind is the most important thing now.
p339_353|I had nothing to lose.
p339_354|This is a really serious issue.
p339_355|I thought to myself.
p339_356|Could it be?
p339_357|We're talking to the US.
p339_358|Thereafter they were again in control.
p339_359|It looks as though there is no chance.
p339_360|You have to keep the focus alive.
p339_361|It could have been a ceilidh.
p339_362|I cannot really commit.
p339_363|There are many questions to be answered.
p339_364|Sadly, so did a couple of errors.
p339_365|This is a new beginning.
p339_366|There are moments of honesty, too.
p339_367|They will fight for everything.
p339_368|He is doing just that.
p339_369|The night is young.
p339_370|But there are signs of a revival.
p339_371|I thought it was a great game.
p339_372|Just get on with it.
p339_373|Germany also said it was unimpressed.
p339_374|It shows the Government is listening.
p339_375|She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
p339_376|They want it to work.
p339_377|This is a completely new experience for me.
p339_378|They still have a great sense of humour.
p339_379|It decided to blame the media.
p339_380|We have chosen for the patients.
p339_381|He was at the outset of his career.
p339_382|Our position is quite clear.
p339_383|It could now be up to the courts.
p339_384|We can make a difference.
p339_385|This was not a contest.
p339_386|So far the weather has been very pleasant.
p339_387|Breaching that condition was itself an offence.
p339_388|I cannot describe it.
p339_389|It is not designed to kill.
p339_390|He has run a hell of a race.
p339_391|We'll have to be satisfied with it.
p339_392|Gordon Brown did not inherit a mess.
p339_393|It is good football in Scotland.
p339_394|There is no other option.
p339_395|You can feel the tension in the air.
p339_396|It is a technique.
p339_397|Is it the shape of things to come?
p339_398|My body is exhausted.
p339_399|It is about more than Scotland.
p339_400|It's not just going to be busy.
p339_401|She was on the edge of breaking point.
p339_402|The first appeared to be successful.
p339_403|She was so supportive.
p339_404|I'm delighted with our performance.
p340_001|Please call Stella.
p340_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p340_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p340_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p340_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p340_006|When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p340_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p340_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p340_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p340_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p340_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p340_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p340_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p340_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p340_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p340_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p340_017|Others have tried to explain this phenomenon physically.
p340_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p340_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p340_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p340_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p340_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p340_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p340_025|It would be nice.
p340_026|We are not prepared to do that.
p340_027|We've just decided to do something about it.
p340_028|It's a horrific incident.
p340_029|But it's not just about that.
p340_030|We've not won anything yet.
p340_031|He was very close.
p340_032|But someone has to take them.
p340_033|We don't find any danger from them.
p340_034|Do you think they would do any better?
p340_035|They were appalling, disgraceful.
p340_036|Who was that?
p340_037|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
p340_038|This is my personal assessment.
p340_039|It is a recipe for success.
p340_040|You've got to have everything inside with you.
p340_041|We didn't deserve to win.
p340_042|This is great news.
p340_043|We can hardly talk about it.
p340_044|That was a month ago.
p340_045|I have lost all confidence.
p340_046|It would be another reason to live.
p340_047|I felt under a lot of pressure.
p340_048|None of the pieces was commissioned.
p340_049|It is somewhere to be.
p340_050|But it was no problem.
p340_051|This has been a difficult time for me.
p340_052|These people are not big names.
p340_053|Don't you believe it.
p340_054|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
p340_055|We did something about it.
p340_056|Where is the money coming from?
p340_057|It needs a rethink.
p340_058|Why does it work?
p340_059|He would have been wrong.
p340_060|He played really, really well.
p340_061|He was right of course.
p340_062|It's there for people to look at.
p340_063|Together, we can make a difference.
p340_064|That, however, was the exception.
p340_065|This has been a long process.
p340_066|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p340_067|It's probably just as well.
p340_068|It is time for the talking to stop.
p340_069|We were very close.
p340_070|If only it were so.
p340_071|They do not deliver.
p340_072|However, that is just for starters.
p340_073|This can be extreme.
p340_074|I'm sure that they will learn.
p340_075|Would she remember the music?
p340_076|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p340_077|Two options are being proposed.
p340_078|Mr Masterton said he was very hopeful.
p340_079|He is now back in Britain.
p340_080|There was no commission.
p340_081|There was a vacuum.
p340_082|It is time to be realistic.
p340_083|Everyone in front of me was dead.
p340_084|Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
p340_085|It is a potential danger.
p340_086|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p340_087|But we never wanted to do that here.
p340_088|There was no hint of scandal.
p340_089|The money will go straight to the headteacher.
p340_090|He said, we're delighted by the vote.
p340_091|It could be to do with the location.
p340_092|This is a terrible tragedy.
p340_093|The teenager had been missing for six months.
p340_094|I'm delighted to be coming back home.
p340_095|He said he never saw it.
p340_096|It is a matter of clarity.
p340_097|You will never get a conviction.
p340_098|He did not have to stop and think.
p340_099|We deserved to win it.
p340_100|Or did it?
p340_101|It's just not funny!
p340_102|His own excitement is never difficult to detect.
p340_103|He almost admitted as much.
p340_104|So what is the problem?
p340_105|We believe it to be completely without merit.
p340_106|He didn't bother a soul.
p340_107|That was my first reaction.
p340_108|Fishing is a declining industry.
p340_109|Another man said, It was horrible.
p340_110|That's the way it goes.
p340_111|But we still don't know.
p340_112|Are there any he wants to play?
p340_113|The film is on a tightrope.
p340_114|It was a question of patience.
p340_115|I have never been in anything like that.
p340_116|I have done ever since it was published.
p340_117|We have got to the top.
p340_118|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p340_119|And it worked, so we kept it.
p340_120|The king is delighted by the honour.
p340_121|Johnsen is equally concerned.
p340_122|My body is clearly capable.
p340_123|Yes, we can beat them.
p340_124|She was not hard done by.
p340_125|They said they were only young men.
p340_126|We are in the end game.
p340_127|This is not the case.
p340_128|There may be some resistance.
p340_129|It is the same old story.
p340_130|You need that freedom in society.
p340_131|It is a strong case.
p340_132|Who do you think will win?
p340_133|I certainly would not accept this decision.
p340_134|That was one very hard game.
p340_135|He said something in his work.
p340_136|I recommend a tour.
p340_137|This research is extremely promising.
p340_138|I was invited to work in Germany.
p340_139|Weather conditions were good, he added.
p340_140|Don't hold your breath.
p340_141|He was shaking like a leaf.
p340_142|I have a moral dilemma.
p340_143|It looks like a hit.
p340_144|How did he know?
p340_145|He will have to live with his words.
p340_146|Openness is always the best way.
p340_147|It added to the spectacle.
p340_148|They are working very well.
p340_149|And he listens to his artists as well.
p340_150|He is advised that he has done so.
p340_151|Annika is very, very fit.
p340_152|This is not quite right.
p340_153|It really is tremendous.
p340_154|I've never regretted my decision.
p340_155|This is a recipe for disaster.
p340_156|The wind was coming from all directions.
p340_157|So we started building a home.
p340_158|He was as good as his word.
p340_159|It will not happen overnight.
p340_160|Surely it can't get any worse.
p340_161|He has to learn.
p340_162|He, too, will return.
p340_163|What then is wrong?
p340_164|My brother is not like that.
p340_165|He was very fit.
p340_166|It was very exciting.
p340_167|It is clear that change is required.
p340_168|They did a very good job.
p340_169|It has been a waste of time.
p340_170|As far as we're concerned, the matter is closed.
p340_171|He had no previous convictions.
p340_172|It is no more than a shell.
p340_173|And did they have sex?
p340_174|But he was a really nice man.
p340_175|It was very close.
p340_176|It should be scrapped.
p340_177|It gives us hope.
p340_178|We can't determine that clearly.
p340_179|They are just trying to cover up.
p340_180|Are you the man from The Herald?
p340_181|And that's it?
p340_182|I came here this week to work.
p340_183|We are really good friends.
p340_184|But that is not an issue for now.
p340_185|Of course the ending was fantastic.
p340_186|I want to be frank.
p340_187|This was an option from the beginning.
p340_188|Clearly he is keeping in touch.
p340_189|Yet it seemed to work.
p340_190|I think it was just a tragic accident.
p340_191|We haven't been able to go and see.
p340_192|It works, as well.
p340_193|I can't say anything.
p340_194|I would be interested in another attempt.
p340_195|However, that is a sizeable if.
p340_196|There is no other way.
p340_197|This was all well and good.
p340_198|This is a disaster for us.
p340_199|What does that mean?
p340_200|This is your life.
p340_201|He has seen the past.
p340_202|He can be beaten.
p340_203|He had been on holiday visiting his grandmother.
p340_204|Why does he do it?
p340_205|That's my daughter acting.
p340_206|They are very clever and very dangerous.
p340_207|It wouldn't matter if he had.
p340_208|We lost out a little bit.
p340_209|Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
p340_210|I had just taken it off.
p340_211|The family baton is handed on.
p340_212|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p340_213|It was properly reported to us.
p340_214|He was outstanding today - the best player on the park.
p340_215|The seller was not revealed.
p340_216|Everything happened so quickly.
p340_217|How can this be?
p340_218|I am feeling a bit better.
p340_219|Everyone here is heartbroken.
p340_220|Not so, it seems.
p340_221|He was also a great man.
p340_222|We have no further comment to make.
p340_223|This produces exactly the opposite effect.
p340_224|Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
p340_225|You have to keep it on the fairways.
p340_226|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p340_227|So there, we won.
p340_228|I don't like to fail.
p340_229|I really didn't think he would.
p340_230|He may have a long wait.
p340_231|They have already done that.
p340_232|Later, a very different story emerged.
p340_233|So it should be.
p340_234|They didn't find any substance.
p340_235|It's hard to say.
p340_236|Her heart was not in it.
p340_237|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
p340_238|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p340_239|They are now collapsing.
p340_240|He had been surprised by the local reaction.
p340_241|Government funding is not a problem.
p340_242|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
p340_243|We just did not want to believe it.
p340_244|The medal itself is not that important.
p340_245|I should think so, too.
p340_246|The time for change is now.
p340_247|They deserved to beat us in the replay.
p340_248|Can they be serious?
p340_249|We've got to get this right.
p340_250|The film was great.
p340_251|I'm just enjoying every match.
p340_252|They set up to win the hole.
p340_253|I am not a liar.
p340_254|Let's make this clear.
p340_255|We also hope to meet the men.
p340_256|It was quite simply, delicious.
p340_257|I can't believe it happened.
p340_258|Thankfully it was cleared up.
p340_259|The game will be at a football stadium.
p340_260|They were his words.
p340_261|Shelter also supports the reform.
p340_262|The attack was totally out of the blue.
p340_263|People were very confused.
p340_264|We've had a lot of adjusting to do.
p340_265|I am very relieved.
p340_266|The people have been really friendly.
p340_267|It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
p340_268|Aberdeen were difficult to break down.
p340_269|That, though, is not true.
p340_270|I hope he comes back.
p340_271|They made up for it on Saturday.
p340_272|That was our mission.
p340_273|I am delighted for them.
p340_274|The second half was a different affair.
p340_275|The scheme has been funded by the Government.
p340_276|They might be surprised by the response.
p340_277|I've done it all.
p340_278|We have worked well with them for years.
p340_279|They've had a good start as well.
p340_280|The director's a genius.
p340_281|One thing is clear.
p340_282|We might never see him again.
p340_283|Such as it is.
p340_284|The car was just there.
p340_285|They were very unfair to him.
p340_286|I have spoken to my brother.
p340_287|And that is very good indeed.
p340_288|We could have had no new money.
p340_289|It wasn't an easy decision.
p340_290|It wasn't really like that at all.
p340_291|What will happen to them now?
p340_292|It is set in Paris.
p340_293|The Dream is as hard as they come.
p340_294|We are not collecting.
p340_295|It shows the right amount of progress.
p340_296|I thought the dancing was over.
p340_297|I think they have got it completely right.
p340_298|This is excellent news for Glasgow.
p340_299|He's already made history.
p340_300|Police have appealed for witnesses.
p340_301|There is a lot of fear.
p340_302|They are not left wing.
p340_303|I've heard it all before.
p340_304|We are not there yet.
p340_305|We will not give up on the truth.
p340_306|Sub Not Used, McCall.
p340_307|Now they had it.
p340_308|She died a few days later.
p340_309|What is their concern?
p340_310|The difference was amazing.
p340_311|That is why we are here.
p340_312|But it is historic.
p340_313|You have to feel for the guy.
p340_314|I have still to hear about that.
p340_315|I'm going to win the next two.
p340_316|You know it was good fun.
p340_317|They want that school.
p340_318|They have not changed at all.
p340_319|One is investment, one is reform.
p340_320|The last few weeks have been really bad.
p340_321|Structural changes will never be enough.
p340_322|I am extremely cautious.
p340_323|That was always the danger.
p340_324|Will they fall in love?
p340_325|There was nothing sinister in that.
p340_326|But don't just take my word for it.
p340_327|Is that what it's about?
p340_328|And the audience is a surprise.
p340_329|They worked on it for three hours.
p340_330|Let's make him a show.
p340_331|I'd never heard anything like it before.
p340_332|People are using it in their daily lives.
p340_333|It seemed so personal.
p340_334|Would that be for men and women?
p340_335|The government agreed to pay.
p340_336|I think we have got the balance right.
p340_337|It was a very terrible thing.
p340_338|Let's not take too much for granted.
p340_339|It has been an extremely long haul.
p340_340|I'll need to discuss it with my family.
p340_341|She is deeply distressed.
p340_342|They should have listened to me.
p340_343|Well, there can be no complaints about this one.
p340_344|They said they would.
p340_345|When will this change?
p340_346|You know the score.
p340_347|It was like someone had died.
p340_348|I am an innocent man.
p340_349|The improvement today was fantastic.
p340_350|He has been under great pressure.
p340_351|I'm looking forward to coming home.
p340_352|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p340_353|Our Great Depression is our lives.
p340_354|He was elected as a councillor last year.
p340_355|I just did not cope with the pressure.
p340_356|But he did not appear.
p340_357|So he was anxious to try something new.
p340_358|The time was right.
p340_359|It all happened so quickly.
p340_360|It is working well.
p340_361|They really want to do it.
p340_362|He said nothing of the sort.
p340_363|Governments will have to respond.
p340_364|It simply doesn't happen.
p340_365|We wanted to do something different.
p340_366|The past is history, not destiny.
p340_367|I love it here.
p340_368|Things are on track.
p340_369|Frankly it was disgusting.
p340_370|It is a tragedy for the area.
p340_371|He was not entirely correct.
p340_372|I'm sorry if any offence has been caused.
p340_373|War is not the action.
p340_374|There are not enough of them.
p340_375|It has been a frustrating one.
p340_376|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p340_377|But we wouldn't want them any other way.
p340_378|What's in a name?
p340_379|It feels like a winner already.
p340_380|They are expected to be released today.
p340_381|There was no question of him not impressing.
p340_382|We were all afraid.
p340_383|I hadn't had that before.
p340_384|We have a plan in place.
p340_385|That is to miss the point.
p340_386|It will be a new experience.
p340_387|I didn't see it.
p340_388|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p340_389|IT had to happen.
p340_390|It is a challenge for all of us.
p340_391|The children are fine.
p340_392|I don't believe in God.
p340_393|There's also the point.
p340_394|It's good to be back.
p340_395|It wasn't the second one.
p340_396|He got his degree.
p340_397|And rugby fans can help.
p340_398|Detectives are still working on the case.
p340_399|I reported it but nothing was done.
p340_400|They were not defeated.
p340_401|There was much to be positive about.
p340_402|It wants them to go home.
p340_403|I had a ball today.
p340_404|Yet the improvement in behaviour was huge.
p341_001|Please call Stella.
p341_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p341_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p341_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p341_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p341_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p341_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p341_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p341_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p341_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p341_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p341_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p341_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
p341_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p341_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p341_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p341_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p341_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p341_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p341_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p341_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p341_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p341_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p341_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p341_025|This guy is never going to give up.
p341_026|That's interesting to me.
p341_027|I managed to take her completely by surprise.
p341_028|It is only one night, after all.
p341_029|The injuries are not too serious.
p341_030|Gilbert was not amused.
p341_031|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
p341_032|It has moved on in the last week.
p341_033|Everything was up for grabs.
p341_034|It's easy to see why.
p341_035|I am proud of moments like that.
p341_036|That was no surprise to me.
p341_037|This has been blown out of all proportion.
p341_038|There is no escape.
p341_039|It's wonderful to have won.
p341_040|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p341_041|He was arrested, but later released without charge.
p341_042|I fell into it by accident.
p341_043|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p341_044|This is a big advantage.
p341_045|Her daughter is getting married.
p341_046|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
p341_047|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
p341_048|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p341_049|Today is not about contracts.
p341_050|That says something for his strength of character.
p341_051|We are going for it.
p341_052|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p341_053|It's to do with play.
p341_054|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p341_055|I've just got to do this.
p341_056|It's not, of course, a concert hall.
p341_057|So the process was refined.
p341_058|Labour accused the Tory leader of panicking.
p341_059|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p341_060|I think it is a sensible change.
p341_061|Sex is fun?
p341_062|They were not doing it too well, either.
p341_063|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p341_064|This is the crossroads.
p341_065|He had played well in that central role.
p341_066|He is pretty upset.
p341_067|And who would argue with that?
p341_068|Where is the human rights?
p341_069|We must put a marker down.
p341_070|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p341_071|Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
p341_072|It is time to give her a rest.
p341_073|They had had time for little else.
p341_074|The feeling is awesome.
p341_075|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p341_076|But there was a shift.
p341_077|The settlement could run to millions.
p341_078|It does not stop at the border.
p341_079|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p341_080|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p341_081|Robert is a special talent.
p341_082|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
p341_083|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
p341_084|They are going to carry it through.
p341_085|She added, It is a huge problem.
p341_086|You can't keep them separate.
p341_087|The composer therefore believes he can do it.
p341_088|I still feel like a wee boy.
p341_089|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p341_090|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p341_091|It had a gigantic effect.
p341_092|Israel has done very little until now.
p341_093|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p341_094|We are losing this war.
p341_095|It's a difficult one to play.
p341_096|The death rates are still as high.
p341_097|We are seeing a Government in a hurry.
p341_098|It is a great honour and a privilege.
p341_099|We certainly will need to watch him.
p341_100|I don't think it could be clearer.
p341_101|That meant the search was unlawful.
p341_102|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p341_103|People buy everything with cash.
p341_104|We are trying to establish a date.
p341_105|He is a law unto himself.
p341_106|The website is now being amended.
p341_107|There was great support all round the route.
p341_108|I was a bit nervous.
p341_109|It was a bit of a struggle today.
p341_110|It was love of Helen and the children.
p341_111|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
p341_112|I love this tournament.
p341_113|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p341_114|He had a heart problem.
p341_115|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p341_116|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p341_117|Both managements are very supportive.
p341_118|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
p341_119|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p341_120|The choice is strictly personal.
p341_121|We are going to go about our lives.
p341_122|He had other things on his mind.
p341_123|The lady is right.
p341_124|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p341_125|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p341_126|The next few months will tell.
p341_127|I'm so proud of my team.
p341_128|It is crucial for both teams.
p341_129|It ended as it began, in confusion.
p341_130|I am now just a bit uneasy.
p341_131|You can see their point.
p341_132|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p341_133|There was no hint of bravado.
p341_134|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
p341_135|Yet he chose to do something different.
p341_136|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
p341_137|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p341_138|There were no casualties.
p341_139|The case will now go to appeal.
p341_140|They really did a great job.
p341_141|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p341_142|They are still going to be impulsive.
p341_143|I love you so very much.
p341_144|He is a very nice man.
p341_145|The road was closed for several hours.
p341_146|Their condition was described as stable.
p341_147|There's a good chance of seeing something.
p341_148|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p341_149|I had a tie in my hand.
p341_150|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p341_151|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
p341_152|Such a city does not exist.
p341_153|My aim is a top six finish.
p341_154|He came in an army uniform.
p341_155|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p341_156|It was to no avail.
p341_157|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p341_158|But my heart is in athletics.
p341_159|That is in the very nature of farming.
p341_160|You shouldn't have a stoppage in November.
p341_161|These matters are now behind us.
p341_162|I'm working on that.
p341_163|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p341_164|It was then into overtime.
p341_165|Most of the public are behind me.
p341_166|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
p341_167|It really is a gift to the world.
p341_168|Look at his last couple of records.
p341_169|I am still very much a director.
p341_170|We must not give in to bastards.
p341_171|She may even appear in some more films.
p341_172|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
p341_173|My house was shaking at the time.
p341_174|They will know they deserve to be there.
p341_175|Of course he is.
p341_176|This is a very positive step forward.
p341_177|This is a huge confidence boost.
p341_178|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p341_179|And does it?
p341_180|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p341_181|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p341_182|Nobody ever knew it had happened.
p341_183|She is a very lucky lady.
p341_184|It's the whole season.
p341_185|We've been there for seven years.
p341_186|Promises were not kept.
p341_187|His signature is his handwriting.
p341_188|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p341_189|I've already done that.
p341_190|We are on the path of change.
p341_191|You can feel at home in China.
p341_192|Who is he?
p341_193|It has to be a long-term commitment.
p341_194|No such remedy has ever been pursued.
p341_195|Felt good about it.
p341_196|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p341_197|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p341_198|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p341_199|What's the big idea?
p341_200|One season, they might do well.
p341_201|It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
p341_202|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
p341_203|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p341_204|It's up to their parents to choose.
p341_205|I feel privileged to be here.
p341_206|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
p341_207|She told me to apply for the crest.
p341_208|Too much has already been said.
p341_209|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p341_210|He explained to his audience.
p341_211|I think the Government should pay for that.
p341_212|I asked why he had come.
p341_213|He was a soldier.
p341_214|The budget was too low for that.
p341_215|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p341_216|It didn't get any better.
p341_217|I'm a bit annoyed.
p341_218|He doesn't like the Labour Party.
p341_219|I am totally devoted to this job.
p341_220|I just could not cope.
p341_221|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p341_222|It is all one-sided.
p341_223|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p341_224|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p341_225|Here are some possible solutions.
p341_226|That's the day job.
p341_227|Glasgow is going to be open for business.
p341_228|IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
p341_229|I'm not saying he is finished.
p341_230|That probably wouldn't happen at Liverpool.
p341_231|He is well respected by his colleagues.
p341_232|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
p341_233|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p341_234|I would have dropped out otherwise.
p341_236|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
p341_237|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
p341_238|We believe we have a strong case.
p341_239|I lost it at the final whistle.
p341_240|Bill is a mentor.
p341_241|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p341_242|I think he has undergone a sea change.
p341_243|One must hope not!
p341_244|It was a big day.
p341_245|What makes a house a home?
p341_246|I think however, he was having a fit!
p341_247|I live on the streets of Glasgow.
p341_248|I will not be pressured.
p341_249|It doesn't make sense.
p341_250|I'll go back home and see my family.
p341_251|He admitted the asylum system was not working.
p341_252|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p341_253|I have heard the stories from Scotland.
p341_254|Sub Not Used, McKay.
p341_255|Do not listen to them.
p341_256|Mind you, who wouldn't?
p341_257|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
p341_258|He loves the big occasions.
p341_259|Our system is archaic.
p341_260|It was a tactical change.
p341_261|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p341_262|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p341_263|This time, there were no such rewards.
p341_264|He said Mr Holland was a disgrace.
p341_265|I gave him a way out, and he took it.
p341_266|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p341_267|She became very good at it.
p341_268|We don't have the credible evidence.
p341_269|It's one up to the Scots.
p341_270|I'm just doing artwork.
p341_271|And we still have to pay his salary.
p341_272|Also, he was flawed.
p341_273|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p341_274|So there's a double whammy.
p341_275|I didn't have a trio.
p341_276|Their three other children had died as infants.
p341_277|That is a mark of what you are.
p341_278|His wife Margaret was not in court.
p341_279|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
p341_280|I hope my successor will do the same.
p341_281|The manager knew me very well.
p341_282|I have been totally taken aback by this.
p341_283|Are you in this movie?
p341_284|We've got a full house tonight.
p341_285|If they don't, they won't get what they want.
p341_286|The fans will support us.
p341_287|Make sure you see it.
p341_288|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p341_289|We are aware of the two incidents.
p341_290|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p341_291|It was just one of those things.
p341_292|The whole team was rubbish.
p341_293|Now we need to keep our heads up.
p341_294|You've got it coming Kabul.
p341_295|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p341_296|They too refused to come out and talk.
p341_297|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
p341_298|It's the curse of our time, irony.
p341_299|That was enough for the committee.
p341_300|It's a source of deep concern.
p341_301|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p341_302|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
p341_303|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
p341_304|It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
p341_305|However, there are also many areas of agreement.
p341_306|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p341_307|The Dow Jones is way up.
p341_308|We have to adapt to this level.
p341_309|They were the better side on the day.
p341_310|What are you going to do exactly?
p341_311|We have lost the round, but not the fight.
p341_312|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p341_313|Calderwood would agree with that.
p341_314|No-one thought about this.
p341_315|We're all in a state of shock.
p341_316|I thought he was part of the camera.
p341_317|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p341_318|Farmers have been an endangered species.
p341_319|This is very bad news.
p341_320|He was released in March this year.
p341_321|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
p341_322|I stayed away from the defence.
p341_323|We do need to get the message across.
p341_324|Instead, she just went away.
p341_325|That did not go down well.
p341_326|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p341_327|It was chaotic and frightening.
p341_328|It is a question of balance.
p341_329|Soon the whole country will be level.
p341_330|And huge, indeed, it is.
p341_331|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p341_332|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p341_333|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p341_334|For his opposite number, this was just triumph.
p341_335|He said he needed no more evidence.
p341_336|People might not actually want the job.
p341_337|It is the logical extension of audio description.
p341_338|It broke up my marriage.
p341_339|They told us about it the next day.
p341_340|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
p341_341|If there is default.
p341_342|We are very nearly there.
p341_343|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
p341_344|We have to go for it.
p341_345|I'm surprised that it has taken this approach.
p341_346|Barry will be able to handle this.
p341_347|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p341_348|The urgency is real.
p341_349|I've already got them in.
p341_350|He takes time out for everyone.
p341_351|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
p341_352|They are just bewildered and very concerned.
p341_353|I can't stop people thinking.
p341_354|The workers said they were treated like animals.
p341_355|I have not been so angry for years.
p341_356|She had every right to read the warrant.
p341_357|This is normal for him now.
p341_358|Nothing was going to go right.
p341_359|There is too much at stake for that.
p341_360|Nobody ever gets to see them.
p341_361|That's an old idea.
p341_362|Scotland is losing business.
p341_363|The place became a war zone.
p341_364|What's happening to her?
p341_365|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
p341_366|Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
p341_367|The surprise is its product is so poor.
p341_368|I don't have a new house.
p341_369|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
p341_370|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
p341_371|You are a liar.
p341_372|Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
p341_373|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p341_374|See it while you can.
p341_375|Folk music is in her blood.
p341_376|And we all understand that.
p341_377|One policeman was killed.
p341_378|And it's not funny.
p341_379|I didn't do too badly myself.
p341_380|We cannot lose it.
p341_381|They have learned from that.
p341_382|We have been working together for some years.
p341_383|Chris Paterson is a class act.
p341_384|We only lost the third goal.
p341_385|And that's the question for the Chamber.
p341_386|That gave us some confidence.
p341_387|No-one has yet been charged.
p341_388|Such people do not exist.
p341_389|Is this new report the answer?
p341_390|Then came the second round.
p343_001|Please call Stella.
p343_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p343_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p343_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p343_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p343_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p343_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p343_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p343_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p343_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p343_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p343_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p343_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p343_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p343_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p343_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p343_019|Since the physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p343_020|Many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p343_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p343_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p343_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p343_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p343_025|I've got a long way to go.
p343_026|I'll go to the races.
p343_027|We will be back next year.
p343_028|I was very, very pleased with our display.
p343_029|It is a crucial award.
p343_030|People don't feel safe, including me.
p343_031|Survival is our aim.
p343_032|But it might have done.
p343_033|Nor is it likely to do so.
p343_034|What can you do?
p343_035|I read it every year.
p343_036|I go in for the parts.
p343_037|It should be the reverse.
p343_038|We are a team of hard workers.
p343_039|It is up to Ann.
p343_040|And you know something?
p343_041|We were with him the whole time.
p343_042|That was the theory, anyway.
p343_043|We've all been here before.
p343_044|I had troubles with the producers.
p343_045|So, it took me back to boarding school.
p343_046|He died the following year.
p343_047|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p343_048|He is trying really hard.
p343_049|I have no doubt about that.
p343_050|It is a beautiful country.
p343_051|I expect a rapid response.
p343_052|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p343_053|This was never a support group.
p343_054|I must take a seat.
p343_055|My mother is a widow.
p343_056|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
p343_057|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p343_058|The matter will come up again.
p343_059|I don't believe in gesture politics.
p343_060|The decision is purely down to the clinic.
p343_061|He should be a great asset.
p343_062|But that's another story for another day.
p343_063|One thing is sure.
p343_064|He has really done well.
p343_065|I'm just delighted to take it.
p343_066|This happened on three days inside a week.
p343_067|Funding needs to be long term.
p343_068|It's funny how it comes and goes.
p343_069|It was just awful.
p343_070|That is really all.
p343_071|We played too deeply.
p343_072|We could have got three medals.
p343_073|I am ready to go.
p343_074|We are still suffering from that.
p343_075|The script was funny.
p343_076|We are at the crossroads.
p343_077|I am about protecting the state pension.
p343_078|They were at school together.
p343_079|I am looking forward to getting home.
p343_080|Painful, but only because it's true.
p343_081|Once they go away they won't come back.
p343_082|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
p343_083|That was the easy election.
p343_084|I didn't understand it.
p343_085|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p343_086|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p343_087|No one was listening.
p343_088|I will report in the spring.
p343_089|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p343_090|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p343_091|It's terrible that this is happening.
p343_092|He's got the same story.
p343_093|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
p343_094|It is par for the course, of course.
p343_095|And so it goes on.
p343_096|The winner will be announced next month.
p343_097|What was this?
p343_098|I am not a fan of books.
p343_099|It may well have been.
p343_100|Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself.
p343_101|We can only go up.
p343_102|I am not a doctor.
p343_103|It is all in the mind.
p343_104|And we have beaten them before.
p343_105|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
p343_106|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
p343_107|I am not a paedophile.
p343_108|I've got to get noticed!
p343_109|Not that it was needed.
p343_110|It's up to them to decide.
p343_111|But we can't have a casino.
p343_112|I would love to play in Europe again.
p343_113|The odds are that it will.
p343_114|After this, they were always in the driving seat.
p343_115|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p343_116|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
p343_117|He also has property interests in the country.
p343_118|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p343_119|The hearing was expected to last six weeks.
p343_120|I cannot believe this decision.
p343_121|This decision is destroying my family.
p343_122|Why is that?
p343_123|Well, the big day has arrived.
p343_124|We reckon we can do very well.
p343_125|But it's been kept to a minimum.
p343_126|It has been a great day.
p343_127|We are not with you.
p343_128|Then came the crunch.
p343_129|If so, they were wrong.
p343_130|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p343_131|The answer is maybe.
p343_132|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p343_133|The referee had a shocking game.
p343_134|I haven't been able to do it since.
p343_135|It's about doing things.
p343_136|For a few years we had good fun.
p343_137|All the pressure will be on him.
p343_139|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p343_140|That was a good effort.
p343_141|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
p343_142|He must not be removed from office.
p343_143|He had finally had enough.
p343_144|But not all were so defiant.
p343_145|We are not going to get carried away.
p343_146|I told that to the police.
p343_147|On the other hand, the poster did not help.
p343_148|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
p343_149|But when we do it it is great.
p343_150|I'm going to win the gold.
p343_151|He pleaded for caution.
p343_152|It always had to be about the gym.
p343_153|Only one got through.
p343_154|It's like a garage.
p343_155|They've been wonderful to me.
p343_157|I can't believe the buzz.
p343_158|It is a traffic warden.
p343_159|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
p343_160|It had been played at festivals.
p343_161|That never came to court as a charge.
p343_162|Dancing was her life.
p343_163|The latter way is my way.
p343_164|Staff have been informed.
p343_165|It is one of those things.
p343_166|His is a success story by any standard.
p343_167|Are his works inside out?
p343_168|He can do no wrong.
p343_169|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
p343_170|Do they have to create seven majors?
p343_171|It has been handled entirely properly.
p343_172|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p343_173|Is something which we just don't do.
p343_174|That began as an accident.
p343_175|It is, though the law is not clear cut.
p343_176|He will want to utilise the midfield.
p343_177|Two others were also seriously injured.
p343_178|I am looking forward to this film.
p343_179|This has been very frustrating for him.
p343_180|The talking cannot go on too long.
p343_181|I've got a young family.
p343_182|I hope that that will be forthcoming.
p343_183|But experience is a wonderful thing.
p343_184|Footage has been passed on to the police.
p343_185|Of course, there was still much to be done.
p343_186|If he does, he has a real chance of gold.
p343_187|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p343_188|It was good today.
p343_189|She really suffered for her art.
p343_190|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p343_191|That tells you something.
p343_192|It has been a magical moment.
p343_193|Is that not uncanny?
p343_194|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p343_195|The hotel was huge.
p343_196|These days are over.
p343_197|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p343_198|Well, you can have a tree.
p343_199|Or so it is hoped.
p343_201|He said to give a local injection.
p343_202|This is an internal matter.
p343_203|Entries from the event are still being accepted.
p343_204|They made such decisions in London.
p343_205|That has proved to be a lasting lesson.
p343_206|I was influenced by all of these things.
p343_207|He is helping police with their inquiries.
p343_208|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p343_209|Children also died in Britain.
p343_210|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
p343_211|We want to get there.
p343_213|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p343_214|He said he would appeal the sentences.
p343_215|The hearing was fair.
p343_216|He has the edge.
p343_217|This was not a summit about the euro.
p343_218|If he leaves, the band is finished.
p343_219|He saw it all as a big game.
p343_220|I didn't actually work up a speech.
p343_221|Here we have not had one hour.
p343_222|That was never their agenda.
p343_223|But he kept on repeating it.
p343_224|She is currently in foster care.
p343_225|That's the only thing that matters.
p343_226|They were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p343_227|The service will only survive with change.
p343_228|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p343_229|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
p343_230|You have a very persuasive president.
p343_231|It's always the same, isn't it?
p343_232|She has not returned to work.
p343_233|We could learn a lot from them.
p343_234|He is the saviour of South Africa.
p343_235|The players are obviously keen to do well.
p343_236|Men should avoid it like the plague.
p343_237|It's really good fun.
p343_238|Our positions remains unchanged.
p343_239|We are expecting a big crowd.
p343_240|Is a drug dealer?
p343_241|We did not complete the process.
p343_242|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
p343_243|Where are you taking her?
p343_244|The weather forecast isn't good.
p343_245|They have not been named.
p343_246|He died later in hospital.
p343_247|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p343_248|He had a great game.
p343_249|It's still got that at its heart.
p343_250|Actually, nothing much will change.
p343_251|We will turn the corner.
p343_252|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p343_253|There were too many mistakes.
p343_254|He says it often enough.
p343_255|However, my position remains the same.
p343_256|It was totally out of the blue.
p343_257|Horses are not affected.
p343_258|It went on forever.
p343_259|I'm not going to change from it.
p343_260|And they are different.
p343_261|It would have been very easily done.
p343_262|He knows the course.
p343_263|That idea is rubbish.
p343_264|There is no room for error.
p343_265|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p343_266|As, indeed, they would be.
p343_267|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
p343_268|We are all suffering.
p343_269|People should make their own decisions.
p343_270|That is a question for the next manager.
p343_271|I knew people on that committee.
p343_273|Again, we were lucky.
p343_274|There was no argument.
p343_275|He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
p343_276|She is a valuable member of Government.
p343_277|I just need a bit of luck.
p343_278|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p343_279|We are talking about one family.
p343_280|He is not a pathetic figure.
p343_281|The error appeared in a warrant.
p343_282|Everything is so new.
p343_283|It may take time to get it back.
p343_284|Would they work together again?
p343_285|I can feel the sound inside.
p343_286|The answer is yes.
p343_287|I believe in debate and dialogue.
p343_288|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p343_289|That is a personal matter.
p343_290|The princess has had other health problems.
p343_291|I would rather say nothing at the moment.
p343_292|The clarity is vital.
p343_293|I could not sit in the stands.
p343_294|He had a decision to make.
p343_295|Strikers like to go to the ground.
p343_296|It makes no influence on the public.
p343_297|It's ahead of Labour.
p343_298|It's the whole package.
p343_299|I was totally wrong.
p343_300|This has got to stop.
p343_301|It was a matter of chance.
p343_302|There is no point of looking any further.
p343_303|It is a real concern.
p343_304|Is it the flight?
p343_306|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
p343_307|Scotland doesn't even have a target.
p343_308|They really shouldn't have put it out.
p343_309|A compromise is essential.
p343_310|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
p343_311|They need to be involved.
p343_312|It was not a cover-up.
p343_313|The children continue to talk to us.
p343_314|You know the sort of thing.
p343_315|I cannot say too much about them.
p343_316|She went home from school and never returned.
p343_317|I will work on her.
p343_318|We told them in August.
p343_319|It is not easy to live in Russia.
p343_320|Green is desperate to play on The Open.
p343_321|What on earth is happening to rugby?
p343_322|It is now being examined.
p343_323|It is so out of character.
p343_324|Otherwise we would all pay the price.
p343_325|Our thoughts are with her.
p343_326|It is time, he said.
p343_327|Everyone believes in it.
p343_328|We must learn to finish.
p343_331|He was a one off.
p343_332|That should give me a chance.
p343_333|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p343_334|It is my last chance.
p343_335|We played them off the pitch.
p343_336|The service from the other players was super.
p343_337|That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.
p343_338|He didn't let me down.
p343_339|You have been warned.
p343_340|We're not comparing like with like.
p343_341|I started on fire a couple of times.
p343_342|The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday.
p343_343|It wasn't good, but we'll get better.
p343_344|They will be up for it for sure.
p343_345|So you let me know.
p343_346|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
p343_347|That will just be the beginning.
p343_348|No one can say that about me.
p343_349|That had not happened on this occasion.
p343_350|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p343_351|As a nation, we must become more active.
p343_352|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
p343_353|It is safe in our hands.
p343_354|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p343_355|We will need to look at that.
p343_356|It comes down to the police in England.
p343_357|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p343_358|It is a gamble.
p343_359|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
p343_360|The tribunal continues today.
p343_361|These things have not happened by accident.
p343_362|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p343_363|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
p343_364|There's a hint of classical.
p343_365|We had to take action to protect them.
p343_366|Surely they were on a hiding to nothing.
p343_367|In the end, however, it all came together.
p343_368|He is a visionary.
p343_369|The warning was lifted late last night.
p343_370|There is always the smell.
p343_371|I have to take some of the blame.
p343_372|And if he hasn't become a musician?
p343_374|He is lying to save his skin.
p343_375|You have to do your research.
p343_376|He really has everything, including a beautiful swing.
p343_377|He took away my childhood.
p343_378|I have spoken to the skipper.
p343_379|The call was ignored.
p345_001|Please call Stella.
p345_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p345_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p345_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p345_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p345_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p345_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p345_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p345_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p345_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p345_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p345_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p345_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p345_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p345_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p345_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p345_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p345_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p345_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p345_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p345_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p345_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p345_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p345_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p345_025|This is a new era.
p345_026|I want to go home.
p345_027|All the people here are local.
p345_028|The racist abuse was terrible.
p345_029|What is the new religion?
p345_030|The Farmer is called an idiot.
p345_031|It's an amazing landscape!
p345_032|I am prepared to step down.
p345_033|It's a lot of pressure on me.
p345_034|We had to laugh.
p345_035|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p345_036|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p345_037|I was completely knackered.
p345_038|I'd rather be singing Verdi.
p345_039|A killer is also on the loose.
p345_040|Rangers are struggling and their team have injuries.
p345_041|You've got to be vigilant.
p345_042|You can see how he made his money.
p345_043|However, there were some alarming findings.
p345_044|Who wants to be a Millionaire?
p345_045|We would certainly consider the proposals.
p345_046|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p345_047|His record with England was not good.
p345_048|The opposite is the case.
p345_049|Who would be a referee?
p345_050|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p345_051|It was time to act.
p345_052|It's a question of fashion.
p345_053|I could never be cool.
p345_054|We will be paying agency rates.
p345_055|Others said he had gone too far.
p345_056|We expect them to deliver for us.
p345_057|He was between people and God.
p345_058|I've never seen anything like it.
p345_059|They were willing us to get a second.
p345_060|No casualties were reported.
p345_061|The classes are taking place.
p345_062|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p345_063|The sleeper was six hours late.
p345_064|There will be no threat to the game.
p345_065|It would be a last resort.
p345_066|That is part of athletics.
p345_067|Who would have known.
p345_068|We were caught out.
p345_069|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p345_070|I haven't made any definite decisions.
p345_071|I had to lie.
p345_072|Among them is his beloved teacher.
p345_073|Everyone was writing me off.
p345_074|How do we get more people in?
p345_075|The defender made an impressive debut.
p345_076|But her parents will never see her again.
p345_077|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p345_078|I have nothing to lose.
p345_079|He would have loved it.
p345_080|We should be capable of managing it, though.
p345_081|It was that kind of afternoon.
p345_082|It is a freedom.
p345_083|What happens next?
p345_084|All our futures will already have been decided.
p345_085|I would have been shot dead in bed.
p345_086|He insisted that his staff were too.
p345_087|They should come clean.
p345_088|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p345_089|I believe that so strongly.
p345_090|That, though, is an old story.
p345_091|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p345_092|They don't work anymore anyway.
p345_093|It's about time something was done about equipment.
p345_094|It was a funny feeling.
p345_095|He was at it again yesterday.
p345_096|You can't go on forever.
p345_097|So far this season this approach is working.
p345_098|However, his involvement was instant.
p345_099|It has to work.
p345_100|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p345_101|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p345_102|There's something about being cut off.
p345_103|This is his personal life.
p345_104|I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
p345_105|If not, a deal could take many months.
p345_106|It's as eventful as it is momentous.
p345_107|I was going to help with the dinner.
p345_108|Would you pay to come and see it?
p345_109|What are they like?
p345_110|I would probably have to agree with him.
p345_111|They were back in favour with the SAC.
p345_112|He had a moustache.
p345_113|I have been thinking about that this week.
p345_114|Let's get it on.
p345_115|Together they will attempt to express the whole.
p345_116|Everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.
p345_117|It is really good news.
p345_118|We just want a fair deal.
p345_119|I'll just have to live with that.
p345_120|Neither of them was badly hurt.
p345_121|He is the Acting and Deputy First Minister.
p345_122|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p345_123|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
p345_124|It is sad and frustrating.
p345_125|Our intentions are real.
p345_126|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p345_127|Finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.
p345_128|She has left the island.
p345_129|That will be the case on Tuesday.
p345_130|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
p345_131|It certainly should not be used too often.
p345_132|The whole matter is done and dusted.
p345_133|I don't know where that one came from.
p345_134|The shooting created panic in the street.
p345_135|He would just say it was terrible.
p345_136|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p345_137|That's not fair to the supporters.
p345_138|I was on my own.
p345_139|They were part of our own family.
p345_140|It doesn't exactly have the same appeal.
p345_141|I don't have any perspective on it.
p345_142|Scotland has lost a great man.
p345_143|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p345_144|In fact, they will not be disciplined.
p345_145|His name has not been released.
p345_146|For some, it was more painful than others.
p345_147|It plainly does not work.
p345_148|His words were not audible.
p345_149|That's a huge amount.
p345_150|See the amazing arrogance of this, they say.
p345_151|It was even worse than at home.
p345_152|I still think he will win.
p345_153|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p345_154|Normally it would be four minutes.
p345_155|It may have been a cry for help.
p345_156|But the damage had been done.
p345_157|No, you couldn't make it up.
p345_158|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p345_159|However, he did not stay there very long.
p345_160|And so they have.
p345_161|I have a great respect for her.
p345_162|I suggest a new plan.
p345_163|IT takes the biscuit.
p345_164|But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
p345_165|We don't have a solution to the problem.
p345_166|Miller was every bit as happy.
p345_167|The result is utterly compelling.
p345_168|But it won't be the same.
p345_169|Other forces were, however, at work.
p345_170|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
p345_171|It is a hobby for me.
p345_172|If only the acting profession was that simple.
p345_173|It was like a kick in the belly.
p345_174|Bombing is the easy option.
p345_175|We should have gone solo.
p345_176|Directing, if you like.
p345_177|That will be the case.
p345_178|Now, it's all right.
p345_179|All will be revealed in due course.
p345_180|They have known the hard times.
p345_181|We don't know what happened.
p345_182|You cannot enter the clubhouse.
p345_183|They had seven children.
p345_184|That in itself is an erotic experience.
p345_185|Death is outside the language.
p345_186|You have a plan?
p345_187|It's all too early.
p345_188|Everything in the world was focused on London.
p345_189|We've seen that time and time again.
p345_190|I was never alone with her, right?
p345_191|It's not only my respect for them.
p345_192|Tonight's matches European Championship.
p345_193|This is a very high price.
p345_194|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p345_195|I never want to have any children.
p345_196|Business has never been so bad.
p345_197|There is no way to do this.
p345_198|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
p345_199|I know my sons.
p345_200|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p345_201|It was too close to call.
p345_202|But who is the killer?
p345_203|No, it's never been mentioned.
p345_204|Things were so intense in the studio.
p345_205|The devil, of course, will be in the detail.
p345_206|Then another one came.
p345_207|Progress is being made but it is slow.
p345_208|Everything has been destroyed.
p345_209|The Lobby is not failing.
p345_210|But it is looking very positive.
p345_211|Drugs are getting through.
p345_212|He would have come into the house.
p345_213|I want to put myself on discussion also.
p345_214|It happens in real life.
p345_215|At the time, he was a living legend.
p345_216|And we will do it.
p345_217|It's a human tragedy.
p345_218|But we are losing that connection.
p345_219|I am going to fight to the end.
p345_220|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p345_221|It's the right thing.
p345_222|That was a disgraceful performance.
p345_223|Must have been at the bar.
p345_224|But this is just the start.
p345_225|I can't get away from it.
p345_226|I believe in the Union.
p345_227|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p345_228|But he is not hopeful.
p345_229|It will be all about the Olympics.
p345_230|They are very frightened.
p345_231|We have all been there at some point.
p345_232|This is my homeland.
p345_233|The game was up.
p345_234|That is not an easy thing.
p345_235|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p345_236|I didn't know where they were.
p345_237|Rangers are my life.
p345_238|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p345_239|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p345_240|There are two options.
p345_241|I can't describe it.
p345_242|Surely it should be the other way round.
p345_243|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p345_244|I get on him, he gets on me.
p345_245|This is wonderful news.
p345_246|I am appalled by this news.
p345_247|No injuries were reported.
p345_248|It is not surprising, but it is appaling.
p345_249|It is understood he had been stabbed.
p345_250|It's too much work.
p345_251|We were extremely arrogant.
p345_252|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
p345_253|THE waiting game continues.
p345_254|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p345_255|I don't think he was being very fair.
p345_256|You've got to fight to stay up.
p345_257|But the foundations have been laid.
p345_258|We're looking for unity in the council.
p345_259|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p345_260|What is so unusual about this case?
p345_261|Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
p345_262|But this is different.
p345_263|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p345_264|It doesn't look good.
p345_265|That will not change.
p345_266|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p345_267|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p345_268|Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
p345_269|It doesn't make a whole lot of difference.
p345_270|There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
p345_271|They've been at it for five hours.
p345_272|This action could have been avoided.
p345_273|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p345_274|And they still have the final to come.
p345_275|Anyone else can apply.
p345_276|He looked like a schoolboy.
p345_277|It was like the old days.
p345_278|But that is about to change.
p345_279|The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
p345_280|We can build on that.
p345_281|It could be a danger.
p345_282|We are not going to be complacent.
p345_283|The only problem was, they were on himself.
p345_284|His body was found in May.
p345_285|He's a joy to follow.
p345_286|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p345_287|I'm sure you all can relate to that.
p345_288|My wife is coming over at the weekend.
p345_289|Sure, he is the best player in the world.
p345_290|It starts to get you down.
p345_291|I don't think we could have expected better.
p345_292|My life has been turned upside down.
p345_293|Somebody has to speak up for common sense.
p345_294|But they miss the whole point.
p345_295|You have to count on other people.
p345_296|I said, What was that about?
p345_297|Immediate action must be taken.
p345_298|This could prove a problem.
p345_299|I was a local hero.
p345_300|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p345_301|It will be extremely difficult for him.
p345_302|It's a gigantic con.
p345_303|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p345_304|This club have been fair to me.
p345_305|I didn't know she could do that.
p345_306|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
p345_307|This is too much like Scotland.
p345_308|I can't say anything about any figure.
p345_309|A counter reaction was.
p345_310|That goes back a long way.
p345_311|I wouldn't have had the abandon.
p345_312|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p345_313|They were not missing much.
p345_314|It should not make the same mistake again.
p345_315|Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
p345_316|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p345_317|It's always a dilemma.
p345_318|As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
p345_319|Is she in trouble?
p345_320|It is a symbolic concert.
p345_321|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p345_322|It is a very beautiful city.
p345_323|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p345_324|But could it afford to run it?
p345_325|I am very happy with him.
p345_326|I was waiting for that question.
p345_327|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p345_328|I am not against a further inquiry.
p345_329|His father said, My son was lucky.
p345_330|WHO would have thought it?
p345_331|We will win the argument.
p345_332|Five years later, the deception continued.
p345_333|I might get an injury very easily.
p345_334|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p345_335|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p345_336|I just want to do the good work.
p345_337|I'm very happy tonight.
p345_338|He was overwhelmed by the response.
p345_339|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p345_340|Now it was serious.
p345_341|This is his first movie.
p345_342|He is already in place.
p345_343|No one would believe him.
p345_344|We live in shorthand.
p345_345|But something has been lost in the translation.
p345_346|Spent three months alone at sea.
p345_347|I made a big mistake.
p345_348|I just know it's a lot.
p345_349|I saw one body.
p345_350|I am very happy.
p345_351|There was no discussion about it.
p345_352|Three hours later, the man was free.
p345_353|It was a very big win for us.
p345_354|I've never felt affection for Emu.
p345_355|Everything is up for grabs.
p345_356|We had a good time.
p345_357|I was utterly hopeless at it, it must be said.
p345_358|This was a good performance.
p345_359|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p345_360|It is not simple.
p345_361|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p345_362|Our task is to complete the picture.
p345_363|It is a road of death.
p345_364|The Government would be ready, they said.
p345_365|Her life is now back on track.
p345_366|I said at the time it was wrong.
p345_367|By now he was very ill with cancer.
p345_368|Anything that was going, really.
p345_369|He will take it in his stride.
p345_370|I don't believe a word of it.
p345_371|I couldn't put my finger on it.
p345_372|People can really get themselves in a mess.
p345_373|The winner will be announced in December.
p345_374|This is bound to happen.
p345_375|Suddenly, there was an audience.
p345_376|It has not yet opened to pupils.
p345_377|The letters are going out today.
p345_378|I did not name it.
p345_379|And therein lies the problem.
p345_380|I also thought, This is a feature film.
p347_001|Please call Stella.
p347_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p347_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p347_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p347_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p347_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p347_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p347_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p347_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p347_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p347_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p347_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p347_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p347_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p347_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p347_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p347_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p347_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p347_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p347_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p347_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p347_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p347_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p347_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p347_025|A crucial moment has arrived.
p347_026|We still have a long, long way to go.
p347_027|Some will be deployed on submarines.
p347_028|There are moments of silence.
p347_029|So now this series has had its day.
p347_030|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p347_031|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
p347_032|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p347_033|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p347_034|That didn't happen for two reasons.
p347_035|His views are hardly surprising.
p347_036|It is time for a new approach.
p347_037|And look at the leading conductors, he says.
p347_038|We have nothing to say about that.
p347_039|We've tried every other way.
p347_040|I'll have to go out and impress.
p347_041|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
p347_043|He had a really frustrating time last year.
p347_044|It does make a big difference.
p347_045|How many cases have there been?
p347_046|Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
p347_047|You can't give in to the vandals.
p347_048|The Old Firm are going nowhere.
p347_049|Everything was an effort.
p347_050|And does it even matter?
p347_051|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p347_052|My parents are exhausted.
p347_053|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p347_054|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p347_055|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
p347_056|My thoughts are with their families.
p347_057|It will come up here.
p347_058|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p347_059|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p347_060|It is a very special city.
p347_061|This is only the start of my season.
p347_062|The message is just not getting through.
p347_063|It sounded awfully like panic.
p347_064|I've taken to the hills.
p347_065|This is a big, big win.
p347_066|The crowd was awesome.
p347_067|My game is in pretty good shape.
p347_068|We were given a break.
p347_069|He already had had complaints.
p347_070|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p347_071|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p347_072|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p347_073|They had not been handcuffed.
p347_074|I think we will join the single currency.
p347_075|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p347_076|You have to rely on each other.
p347_077|One thing is certain.
p347_078|We cannot ask for them back.
p347_079|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p347_080|No-one said anything to me.
p347_081|All of us do.
p347_082|That is in the public domain.
p347_083|The Hague is too good for him.
p347_084|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p347_085|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
p347_086|It's a true story.
p347_087|This is a club on the rise.
p347_088|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p347_089|Theatre is not a museum.
p347_090|It is a hangover effect.
p347_091|This is my life.
p347_092|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p347_093|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p347_094|The thing is to recognise that chance.
p347_095|We gave them the goal.
p347_096|They don't take you to mass graves.
p347_097|There was no option.
p347_098|What's it got to do with art?
p347_099|Could they perhaps be related?
p347_100|But who shot the president?
p347_101|We do not get that impression now.
p347_102|I'm looking forward to that.
p347_103|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
p347_104|Safety was also an issue.
p347_105|That's why he visited.
p347_106|I know a lot of people who don't.
p347_107|There was nobody on the roof.
p347_108|Clark is back on top form.
p347_109|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p347_110|It needs somebody to give way.
p347_111|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p347_112|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p347_113|They are all Arabs.
p347_114|The days of empty promises are over.
p347_115|Henry was strong and talented.
p347_116|That is our unfinished business.
p347_117|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p347_118|Faces from the Eighties.
p347_119|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p347_120|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p347_121|Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
p347_122|You can cope with it.
p347_123|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p347_124|They will do their own thing.
p347_125|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p347_126|We are in the business of selling tickets.
p347_127|It is just part of modern day life.
p347_128|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p347_129|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p347_130|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p347_131|YOU thought it was a headache.
p347_132|All the people thought that we would die.
p347_133|It is never an easy game.
p347_134|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p347_135|No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
p347_136|I don't want to come down.
p347_137|However, it's good to turn the page.
p347_138|I thought it was quite good.
p347_139|He had reason to be pleased.
p347_140|It was important to win the singles.
p347_141|That is impressive by any standards.
p347_142|I felt we needed to bring that in.
p347_143|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p347_144|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p347_145|That alibi is now gone.
p347_146|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p347_147|Too many factors are now working against him.
p347_148|Is the war over?
p347_149|You do have a way out.
p347_150|It is simple, really.
p347_151|I just wasn't very good.
p347_152|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p347_153|But he is not using them.
p347_154|Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
p347_155|I certainly believe we can do it.
p347_156|They've got a sort of unwritten contract.
p347_157|It was a breathtaking moment.
p347_158|That's been our position all along.
p347_159|I was in jail for five years.
p347_160|We have not had a formal request.
p347_161|I never had a childhood.
p347_162|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p347_163|We offered something different.
p347_164|We were very much a happy family.
p347_165|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p347_166|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p347_167|It's going to be epic.
p347_168|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p347_169|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p347_170|She could easily have been killed.
p347_171|British officials said they could not say.
p347_172|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p347_173|I never found my rhythm.
p347_174|I didn't mean to kill her.
p347_175|It is a job creation scheme.
p347_176|In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
p347_177|We might be back next year.
p347_178|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p347_179|The same goes for personnel.
p347_180|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p347_181|In fact, they should have scored three times.
p347_182|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p347_183|This area is perfect for children.
p347_184|The firm was down and almost out.
p347_185|I was chosen to do this.
p347_186|I learned a lot from that.
p347_187|I think we're very different.
p347_188|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p347_189|There was an element of jealousy.
p347_190|Glasgow then took control.
p347_191|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p347_192|My ambitions are still with football.
p347_193|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p347_194|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p347_195|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p347_196|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p347_197|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p347_198|Our approach will be different.
p347_199|It's not right of Labour.
p347_200|It is legally binding.
p347_201|We went straight into the bedroom.
p347_202|Before the games it was pretty open.
p347_203|But you can go beyond that condition.
p347_204|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p347_205|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p347_206|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p347_207|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p347_208|Who can tell?
p347_209|However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
p347_210|They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
p347_211|My attitude is exactly the same as before.
p347_212|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p347_213|Or some thought that they have.
p347_214|He has lost confidence and weight.
p347_215|That was moving the goalposts.
p347_216|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p347_217|A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
p347_218|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p347_219|Two and a half million people have died.
p347_220|It could not be too high.
p347_221|Or so it would appear.
p347_222|Do not forget about Monaco.
p347_223|I hope they understand that.
p347_224|You can never tell.
p347_225|But Annika is just amazing.
p347_226|Our job is to change that.
p347_227|She will also get a pay rise.
p347_228|The damage has been done.
p347_229|It is time for a more honest approach.
p347_230|That's the National Grid.
p347_231|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
p347_232|Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
p347_233|It is a big time for me.
p347_234|There were two things going on at once.
p347_235|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p347_236|It is a cause for concern.
p347_237|Stalkers are capable of killing.
p347_238|That is the key message.
p347_239|It ignores the future.
p347_240|This is the subway.
p347_241|Altman has every right to be bitter.
p347_242|What's the rush?
p347_243|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p347_244|He's in with the furniture.
p347_245|Do not go into government buildings.
p347_246|There is only one caveat.
p347_247|We are still getting signals.
p347_248|What's it got to do with them, anyway?
p347_249|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
p347_250|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p347_251|Everyone can be bought.
p347_252|There are a few changes.
p347_253|You're not going to get hurt.
p347_254|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p347_255|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p347_256|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p347_257|I heard some of his remarks.
p347_258|I am a little bit tired.
p347_259|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
p347_260|I was just overwhelmed.
p347_261|It had been in place since last July.
p347_262|I have just got to get back.
p347_263|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p347_264|Players want to know what is on offer.
p347_265|Well, when did he ever refuse?
p347_266|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
p347_267|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p347_268|The singer's condition was not specified.
p347_269|How much of a cop out is that?
p347_270|The whole region is in shock.
p347_271|It was a journey into a new life.
p347_272|It will be the final push.
p347_273|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p347_274|You were the kidnappers.
p347_275|It is a very interesting subject.
p347_276|Arguably, they have already done it.
p347_277|She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
p347_278|Raymond was always on the outside.
p347_279|The women were on their way home yesterday.
p347_280|I could feel the blood on my face.
p347_281|I am a committed European.
p347_282|There are no plans to change this.
p347_283|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p347_284|It's in the eyes.
p347_285|Working with him is like working with myself.
p347_286|It is just too long since the war.
p347_287|She didn't tell us anything new.
p347_288|I mean it happens.
p347_289|My wife is totally behind me on this.
p347_290|Debbie Harry was cool.
p347_291|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p347_292|Receiving this medal is an honour.
p347_293|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p347_294|Six months later, they returned to Scotland.
p347_295|It is typical of me.
p347_296|Raised the way you want it.
p347_297|However, consumers may take a different view.
p347_298|I know you went back this morning.
p347_299|They played it like a cup final.
p347_300|This has a number of benefits.
p347_301|I will carry on.
p347_302|I think it is a great shame.
p347_303|A review of the decision is being sought.
p347_304|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
p347_305|The chief constable is right.
p347_306|And we were right.
p347_307|That is where the club has gone wrong.
p347_308|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p347_309|Surely it can do better than that?
p347_310|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p347_311|I think that could work to our advantage.
p347_312|I, like an idiot, agreed.
p347_313|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p347_314|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p347_315|We hope this scheme will change that.
p347_316|I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
p347_317|The red card was okay.
p347_318|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p347_319|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p347_320|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p347_321|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p347_322|I was doing well at the hustings.
p347_323|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p347_324|This is my music.
p347_325|I haven't won the world title.
p347_326|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p347_327|It's fantastic to have finally won.
p347_328|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p347_329|There is no date on this document.
p347_330|And now he tells us.
p347_331|I am not changing my event.
p347_332|I know nothing about that.
p347_333|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p347_334|That is as it may be.
p347_335|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p347_336|This is the start of a new campaign.
p347_337|Eleven events are required.
p347_338|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p347_339|You encourage them - you can do it.
p347_340|The winner will be announced by early summer.
p347_341|I always said No.
p347_342|Britain is a peaceful nation.
p347_343|Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
p347_344|It is very much a matter for them.
p347_345|Our future was his future.
p347_346|His name is Michael Owen.
p347_347|It has made a difference.
p347_348|He's got a great chance of making it.
p347_349|Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
p347_350|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p347_351|So now you know.
p347_352|But, at the same time, they made you think about life.
p347_353|It's a very special unit.
p347_354|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
p347_355|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p347_356|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p347_357|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p347_358|Smith has not let him down.
p347_359|Which he can do.
p347_360|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p347_361|They were that poor.
p347_362|And we're talking Big Money.
p347_363|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p347_364|I was a little surprised.
p347_365|It was a bit like having children.
p347_366|With Pierre, you can never be sure.
p347_367|They believed it worked.
p347_368|I'm really proud of my young players.
p347_369|As it happened, it was much more than that.
p347_370|It's an internal matter.
p347_371|They should feel ashamed.
p347_372|You realise what this means?
p347_373|We're delighted about the vote.
p347_374|They were only there for three weeks.
p347_375|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p347_376|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p347_377|It is just completely erased.
p347_378|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p347_379|It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
p347_380|It's not just for classical music.
p347_381|This must be kept in total perspective.
p347_382|Election results are expected soon.
p347_383|All of the names are familiar to me.
p347_384|There are moments of honesty, too.
p347_385|They didn't find anything.
p347_386|Is that where we are?
p347_387|We used to keep our business rates.
p347_388|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p347_389|I suspect that it will.
p347_390|But there's no eye contact.
p347_391|There was no energy behind it.
p347_392|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p347_393|Even for a British Open, this is different.
p347_394|I took a minibus into town.
p347_395|They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
p347_396|Completion is expected by October the following year.
p347_397|It is not a wish list.
p347_398|Some of the players have not progressed.
p347_399|They were both very brave.
p347_400|There is no margin for error.
p347_401|Why should we even be asked to share?
p347_402|It was not a foul.
p347_403|I get very excited by that.
p347_404|The members have clearly spoken.
p351_001|Please call Stella.
p351_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p351_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p351_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p351_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p351_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p351_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p351_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p351_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p351_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p351_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p351_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p351_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p351_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p351_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p351_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p351_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p351_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p351_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p351_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p351_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p351_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p351_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p351_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p351_025|It was by the numbers.
p351_026|I don't think they can complain about that.
p351_027|I have not seen the term immediate.
p351_028|My Dad is a hero.
p351_029|It is my fault.
p351_030|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
p351_031|He added, We have the same desire.
p351_032|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
p351_033|As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
p351_034|Teachers have been given the offer.
p351_035|We have to win every game.
p351_036|They also have good neighbours.
p351_037|Both sides will be aware of this.
p351_038|They are not advertised.
p351_039|I have got a wife to feed.
p351_040|We are getting people into work.
p351_041|Will we ever play together again?
p351_042|What are the barriers?
p351_043|He is keen to stay in public service.
p351_044|Who are the democrats?
p351_045|You had to go and see him.
p351_046|What did you learn in school today?
p351_047|We know we can defend it.
p351_048|That is not the case.
p351_049|He met his wife and married in England.
p351_050|Instead we were shot in the back.
p351_051|This isn't a gimmick.
p351_052|I won't go back.
p351_053|There is no signature on this document.
p351_054|We could not compete with Rangers.
p351_055|There was mystery back then.
p351_056|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
p351_057|Now it has become a big picture.
p351_058|The jury is still out.
p351_059|Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
p351_060|They have been very lucky with the ice.
p351_061|We are not the first to be affected.
p351_062|My players are special.
p351_063|We are the gateway to justice.
p351_064|The devil is in the detail.
p351_065|His handling raises a wider issue.
p351_066|We have got the school holidays on.
p351_067|We can't go home.
p351_068|That just wasn't good enough.
p351_069|The working families tax credit is far better.
p351_070|those who are preparing to give up.
p351_071|It's really good, as long as we play well.
p351_072|I feel alive and good today.
p351_073|She was married with one son.
p351_074|There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
p351_075|It was a pretty terrible day.
p351_076|His track record is impressive.
p351_077|Clearly it is very disturbing.
p351_078|It is tough, but possible.
p351_079|This youngster is so exciting!
p351_080|I don't understand it.
p351_081|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
p351_082|He was rejected because he had retired.
p351_083|I just wanted to get off the course.
p351_084|She was also very brave.
p351_085|He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
p351_086|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p351_087|Things are meant to be.
p351_088|One year later, he finally decided to act.
p351_089|That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.
p351_090|This is already happening.
p351_091|We have a rehearsal.
p351_092|Four had been brought down.
p351_093|Only he's not as young as he looks.
p351_094|The matter is under discussion.
p351_095|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
p351_096|Surely this is not supposed to happen?
p351_097|This is a defining moment in this parliament.
p351_098|They have played their part.
p351_099|They were unable to revive him.
p351_100|He confirmed that the document was valid.
p351_101|In part that reflected the times.
p351_102|That is not true.
p351_103|Yes, it was too short a night.
p351_104|I didn't deserve to be sent off.
p351_106|We have no excuses.
p351_107|- Really you will !
p351_108|The driver was unhurt.
p351_109|Who will pay for this?
p351_110|This is wrong, but it's what is believed.
p351_111|You have caught a serial killer.
p351_112|It's all about money, money, money.
p351_113|What's the problem?
p351_114|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
p351_115|The way forward isn't going to be easy.
p351_116|It's the way we go about it.
p351_117|I will be ridiculed.
p351_118|There's nothing new in that argument.
p351_119|This time it was out of the blue.
p351_120|We need to get the right people in.
p351_121|It is a great shame.
p351_122|We were not going to take that risk.
p351_123|Last night he became one of the hunted.
p351_124|But that isn't what is worrying the Farmer.
p351_125|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p351_126|In my opinion, it was not working perfectly.
p351_127|The truth, of course, is very different.
p351_128|He has something in common with the Wallabies.
p351_129|These will take a little time to develop.
p351_130|I might come back.
p351_131|He said it was the worst possible result.
p351_132|But, still, it wasn't working.
p351_133|That was my mistake.
p351_134|We can play better than that.
p351_135|My whole family is.
p351_136|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
p351_137|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p351_138|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p351_139|There has been no delay on government orders.
p351_140|I think we can overcome it.
p351_141|We will be victorious.
p351_142|The other question is why the scaling down?
p351_143|It was the crowning point of my career.
p351_144|But it will be sorted out this week.
p351_145|It's just a fact.
p351_146|Mr Smith was dismissive.
p351_147|It was a discussion paper.
p351_148|My neighbours are horrified.
p351_149|They will be ready.
p351_150|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
p351_151|He is walking free.
p351_152|There is nothing they can't do.
p351_153|It certainly was a birthday to remember.
p351_154|If you can work, you should work.
p351_155|This was a very tragic accident.
p351_156|THE Paragon Ensemble is back.
p351_157|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
p351_158|It is the voice of the survivors.
p351_159|The whole thing in general is moving on.
p351_160|They might also be parlous.
p351_161|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p351_162|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
p351_163|The other is the existence of male colleagues.
p351_164|I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
p351_165|It is not an escape.
p351_166|It feels that the game is off.
p351_167|He is very confident at the moment.
p351_168|Well, what can you do?
p351_169|It is not the message alone.
p351_170|They will be seen for years to come.
p351_171|I'm really happy with how things went there.
p351_172|He will be greatly missed.
p351_173|Sadly, they don't seem to know.
p351_174|But is that possible?
p351_175|In many ways, that is as important.
p351_176|I think we're going to make it.
p351_177|It was really frustrating.
p351_178|Clubs can only do so much.
p351_179|Many other areas are coming up.
p351_180|It would have very little impact on them.
p351_181|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p351_182|That's the way things are heading.
p351_183|We were extremely poor.
p351_184|The parties have no contact.
p351_185|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
p351_186|We are still paying the price for that.
p351_187|It was better than a soap opera.
p351_188|There will be no change in government.
p351_189|I am just grateful he is alive.
p351_190|This is a special place for me.
p351_191|This was a great result for us, a big result.
p351_192|Our policy is clear.
p351_193|This was an hour before the show.
p351_194|It is crucial to understand this in context.
p351_195|I now know that from memory.
p351_196|Another one said the couple came from Inverness.
p351_197|We expect a full house on the night.
p351_198|He invented the language.
p351_199|We want to play at the worlds.
p351_200|We need to know more about her.
p351_201|I went away to recover fully.
p351_202|Ownership was the game.
p351_203|It makes a huge difference.
p351_204|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p351_205|It's not a new device.
p351_206|Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.
p351_207|Six years is too long.
p351_208|They are not a set of options.
p351_209|It's a very important and beautiful day.
p351_210|If only the problems concerned the players.
p351_211|But it was money well spent.
p351_212|That's the most important thing for me.
p351_213|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p351_214|No decision has yet been made.
p351_215|I have had a lovely summer.
p351_216|Which is fair enough.
p351_217|He took over our lives.
p351_218|The problem is worse in Scotland.
p351_219|This is a historic agreement.
p351_220|He had worked there for only two days.
p351_221|We just want them home.
p351_222|His was the best performance of the day, after all.
p351_223|I was happily surprised.
p351_224|It may not even be possible.
p351_225|I think it is a scandal.
p351_226|Perhaps it was just as well.
p351_227|That, though, was then.
p351_228|I grew up with them.
p351_229|It was the train coming.
p351_230|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p351_231|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
p351_232|Perhaps that was their mistake.
p351_233|We've never seen so many.
p351_234|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p351_235|I am very, very happy.
p351_236|The case was continued.
p351_237|That is important for the club.
p351_238|He is doing the right things.
p351_239|Blood samples were taken.
p351_240|Now he is in charge of this.
p351_241|They want to play in the World Cup.
p351_242|He was embarrassed about what he did.
p351_243|This is excellent news for the workforce.
p351_244|The home team also had their moments.
p351_245|Haven't been so lucky since.
p351_246|He is under no illusions.
p351_247|It got no better.
p351_248|Some were close to tears.
p351_249|It has become a way of life.
p351_250|They seem to turn up for them.
p351_251|That is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
p351_252|Now we are back on top of Europe.
p351_253|Now the show is for public consumption.
p351_254|I want to create events.
p351_255|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
p351_256|The old manager, he didn't like me.
p351_257|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
p351_258|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p351_259|It was like being in prison.
p351_260|I think it was his parents.
p351_261|That is very important to people.
p351_262|I certainly hope not.
p351_263|This is a dream come true for me.
p351_264|No other country has ever won this tournament.
p351_265|There he goes again.
p351_266|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
p351_267|I feel pretty good.
p351_268|It's got to come from me.
p351_269|There were moments of humour too.
p351_270|He has a wealth of experience.
p351_271|Don't you think it was a fine performance?
p351_272|It happens from time to time.
p351_273|All my family are in Scotland, from Glasgow.
p351_274|They were too hard.
p351_275|This is not a message from ministers.
p351_276|We have been very patient.
p351_277|I don't take that view.
p351_278|They have a car and cannot afford another.
p351_279|My only concern is for my children.
p351_280|This is welcome news.
p351_281|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p351_282|We just wish they had done so before.
p351_283|It was a virus.
p351_284|The rest, of course, is history.
p351_285|They chose the latter.
p351_286|That was not the norm.
p351_287|I've not said anything to them, they know.
p351_288|It is giving out the wrong message.
p351_289|I feel it is very irrational.
p351_290|We were used to being in control.
p351_291|He's had a lot of injury problems.
p351_292|Brady lost to Sullivan one hole.
p351_293|It happened again, and again, and again.
p351_294|Does it matter?
p351_295|She thought she was going to die.
p351_296|Were they under-age?
p351_297|You are going to go to jail.
p351_298|It is a very worrying report.
p351_299|I started it, but then forgot all about it.
p351_300|My mind was made up.
p351_301|It was an ongoing exercise.
p351_302|I would love to see it back there.
p351_303|He then did just that.
p351_304|He should have won.
p351_305|He could hardly have been in greater demand.
p351_306|Who can predict?
p351_307|It was all very proper and civilised.
p351_308|I've played them all in the Champions League.
p351_309|Then you see it.
p351_310|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
p351_311|We don't believe anything anymore.
p351_312|Either system could have prevented the crash.
p351_313|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
p351_314|There is good quality.
p351_315|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
p351_316|But these things are happening now.
p351_317|He will be really pleased about this.
p351_318|He had no access to the database.
p351_319|They were not up to the required standard.
p351_320|He also seems to have been around forever.
p351_321|However, it has had only a limited uptake.
p351_322|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
p351_323|Others are expected to do so soon.
p351_324|They were impressive against France.
p351_325|Seven people were already in custody in France.
p351_326|I played well but missed a few chances.
p351_327|Our approach will be different.
p351_328|It's my initial background.
p351_329|The board is currently resolving its differences.
p351_330|They're just a nonsense.
p351_331|That has not been the case, as we now know.
p351_332|He also called in at another farm.
p351_333|But he seemed to enjoy the challenge.
p351_334|He will go a long way.
p351_335|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p351_336|I lost a part of me.
p351_337|It's so much more fun.
p351_338|That's just the kind of thing we have.
p351_339|It's getting to me.
p351_340|So we talked about that for a bit.
p351_341|But he has strong links to Labour.
p351_342|I am proud of my team.
p351_343|I am a doctor.
p351_344|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
p351_345|It will carry on.
p351_346|Our season is not over.
p351_347|I am not retiring.
p351_348|Money is not everything in life.
p351_349|She kept him on a string.
p351_350|It will make a big difference.
p351_351|There was no basis for their arrest.
p351_352|This latter suggestion is very important.
p351_353|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p351_354|The Government has listened.
p351_355|It's only tackling congestion.
p351_356|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p351_357|It's too horrible to think.
p351_358|It can be frightening.
p351_359|He was, but only just.
p351_360|It may be his last for a while, too.
p351_361|Further details are expected later.
p351_362|What's wrong with that?
p351_363|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p351_364|Off with their heads.
p351_365|I believe she was elected unopposed.
p351_366|We are not asking for the moon.
p351_367|Now we see the impact of global politics.
p351_368|The pain is still acute.
p351_369|This was not the show for me.
p351_370|It is a very big problem.
p351_371|Frustration is not the word.
p351_372|The police have to act to help them.
p351_373|The cause is just.
p351_374|It may be down, but New York is not out.
p351_375|Our message is getting through.
p351_376|But what lies ahead?
p351_377|She makes me so happy.
p351_378|They promised to fight the plans.
p351_379|My heart is not so sure.
p351_380|I am happy for her.
p351_381|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p351_382|They were just too good for us.
p351_383|He was the architect.
p351_384|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p351_385|It's a fantastic achievement.
p351_386|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
p351_387|Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.
p351_388|He, too, was not satisfied.
p351_389|It's easy to see why.
p351_390|But it didn't happen.
p351_391|All were believed to be adults.
p351_392|This is the last straw.
p351_393|The research was my life.
p351_394|I am so, so, so lucky.
p351_395|What is it about this series?
p351_396|You read it right.
p351_397|They would have been forgiven for doing so.
p351_398|I only wanted to give her a fright.
p351_399|Where does it come from?
p351_400|You find it bizarre?
p351_401|I am very excited about this season.
p351_402|It has proved a double whammy.
p351_403|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p351_404|It should be a great game, though.
p364_001|Please call Stella.
p364_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p364_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p364_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p364_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p364_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p364_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p364_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p364_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p364_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p364_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p364_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p364_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p364_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p364_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p364_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p364_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p364_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p364_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p364_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p364_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p364_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p364_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p364_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p364_025|Is that not pathetic?
p364_026|Our nation has been changed by this event.
p364_027|That would be a big step forward.
p364_028|I love you so very much.
p364_029|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
p364_030|Prime minister Blair is not that way.
p364_031|But at the moment there isn't the budget.
p364_032|It is not a matter of concern.
p364_033|We're not either of those things.
p364_034|The man has already had too many chances.
p364_035|It shouldn't be a problem.
p364_036|It was very moving, actually.
p364_037|It isn't a free-for-all.
p364_038|PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines.
p364_039|I was not fit enough and it showed.
p364_040|I thought it was the only way out.
p364_041|We welcome the ministers decision.
p364_042|Since then it has become a tradition.
p364_043|The concept is simple.
p364_044|That is how the Farmer is feeling today.
p364_045|And that's the trouble with this business.
p364_046|So what did he do?
p364_047|We must not give in to bastards.
p364_048|The trial will open today.
p364_049|But it didn't happen.
p364_050|What do you think they said?
p364_051|There will be no disruption in the schools.
p364_053|I can live with that.
p364_054|There is no doubt about that.
p364_055|The president took offence.
p364_056|Our commitment is to move forward.
p364_057|Partly, it is his own fault.
p364_058|That's where it all started.
p364_059|The family is so happy for him.
p364_060|Why has it taken so long?
p364_061|No-one knows the numbers.
p364_062|You make the choice.
p364_063|It is not the fault of one man, of course.
p364_064|I knew the script.
p364_065|It's not going to work.
p364_066|He leaves a beat.
p364_067|Perhaps it was her demeanour.
p364_068|I see no need to change.
p364_069|It lasted longer than we thought.
p364_070|They've got more time.
p364_071|They made a huge impression on me.
p364_072|There is no hiding place.
p364_073|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p364_074|This was a massive result for us.
p364_075|It's not in my nature.
p364_076|You see - this business is a good one.
p364_077|Who is he?
p364_078|Scotland were on Saturday.
p364_079|He wanted to talk to me about it.
p364_081|That would be a big mistake.
p364_082|No-one has spoken to me.
p364_083|His arrival could be the making of them.
p364_084|I was close enough.
p364_085|He dismissed the action.
p364_086|I said How much?
p364_087|I support the stand that they are making.
p364_088|The couple had one daughter.
p364_089|But was it really so big?
p364_090|Nature will not find its own level.
p364_091|I didn't have the choice.
p364_092|But this has already been rejected.
p364_094|They have not seen her for years.
p364_095|It was good to score the goal today.
p364_096|Allison is not convinced.
p364_097|He felt there was no case to answer.
p364_098|This is a one-off.
p364_099|He liked to talk.
p364_100|Lots of others were doing the same.
p364_101|It is still holding good today.
p364_102|This takes the pressure off.
p364_103|Our legal advice is clear.
p364_104|But he has a lifeline.
p364_105|This is a horrible loss.
p364_106|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
p364_107|We are not leaving the area.
p364_108|The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
p364_109|Success in Scotland is important.
p364_110|We could do a lot worse.
p364_111|I know the worry over Iraq.
p364_112|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p364_113|It was just great.
p364_114|You are always aware of the injury potential.
p364_115|We don't know what is happening to them.
p364_116|It's an old story.
p364_117|It was an important part of the course.
p364_118|It has been a great success.
p364_119|I will be trying to do better tomorrow.
p364_120|Who will take them after that?
p364_121|It is part of their job.
p364_122|This decision is a victory for common sense.
p364_123|One is too many.
p364_124|What can you say?
p364_125|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p364_126|The money all appears to be gone.
p364_127|He was extremely ill.
p364_128|This time, it was not be.
p364_129|They are unable to say anything.
p364_130|The timing is wrong.
p364_131|That's why he is a national treasure.
p364_132|He just attracted people.
p364_133|He will be fine.
p364_134|I love a clever reader.
p364_135|There will be no exceptions to this rule.
p364_136|But he's a very quiet man.
p364_137|Destruction came from within.
p364_138|It's not their fault.
p364_140|It won the match.
p364_141|New investment will be openly tendered.
p364_142|I'd never have called a doctor for myself.
p364_143|It is sponsored by The Herald.
p364_144|I don't entirely buy that.
p364_145|It was the rugby writers dinner in London.
p364_146|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p364_147|I would say so.
p364_148|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p364_149|It's a good story.
p364_150|Do not listen to them.
p364_151|It was too soon.
p364_152|It is an absolute disgrace.
p364_153|I don't think it is the case.
p364_154|Everyone would have been happy.
p364_155|It has paid off.
p364_156|Ferguson had done his homework.
p364_157|He deserved that much.
p364_158|We want to know about the policy.
p364_159|Mr Blair defended his wife.
p364_160|He has gone back to school.
p364_161|It is not illegal.
p364_162|I don't know where it went.
p364_163|There was nothing anyone could do.
p364_164|I don't want to use the term.
p364_165|I really feel sorry for the Irish.
p364_166|Now they have to do something about it.
p364_167|The post will be unpaid.
p364_168|One-third of the places are already taken.
p364_169|I hope that doesn't happen.
p364_170|It's all happening at a local level.
p364_171|You will never replace the child.
p364_172|We must do that.
p364_173|England will be under a lot of pressure.
p364_174|This has been fantastic.
p364_175|I'm delighted for the lads.
p364_176|I learned that only yesterday.
p364_177|It's very very frustrating.
p364_178|We want him to continue that way.
p364_179|But he did not rule out further talks.
p364_180|Our children are our future.
p364_181|It's part of your life.
p364_182|We will see how he is.
p364_183|He had a horror.
p364_184|So it was in politics.
p364_185|There are two offerings from Scotland.
p364_187|The matter has been reported to the police.
p364_188|We are at war.
p364_189|We do know the reaction of the SAC.
p364_190|The state is controlled by the left.
p364_191|The principle is quite clear.
p364_192|Despite that, it was a great day for me.
p364_193|I would say the risk is very small.
p364_194|And there are different perspectives.
p364_195|Mr Wallace was unimpressed.
p364_196|I put the drawing down.
p364_197|The hearing continues today.
p364_198|You would be wrong.
p364_199|On recent evidence, he will not be missed.
p364_200|Police have refused to name the couple involved.
p364_201|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p364_202|The attitude was good today.
p364_203|I've got nothing to say.
p364_204|It requires a wider team.
p364_205|It is so beautiful.
p364_206|It is suitable and sensible.
p364_207|In many ways it was disastrous.
p364_208|I am really, really happy.
p364_209|This is perfectly legal.
p364_210|I'm not interested in money.
p364_211|I'm looking forward to racing Donovan.
p364_212|I can handle the pace.
p364_213|I am happy to be here.
p364_214|We are seeking a meeting with the Minister.
p364_215|I believe it would have been successful.
p364_216|It's better to be happy.
p364_217|It's happened, but it's a dream.
p364_218|I had a son.
p364_219|It was very, very frightening.
p364_220|That suggests that out fitness is good.
p364_221|I had no choice.
p364_222|What do you do.
p364_223|It would also delay the Scottish results.
p364_224|This one would have been.
p364_225|We just have to improve.
p364_226|It hasn't worked out that way.
p364_227|This is very good news.
p364_228|Is it a warning to parents?
p364_229|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
p364_230|There is nothing wrong with that.
p364_231|I could not believe the results.
p364_232|What do you do?
p364_233|And there are some interesting conductors, too.
p364_234|It was all over for us then.
p364_235|They were assured that it would.
p364_236|Thankfully they liked it.
p364_237|I am very encouraged by this poll.
p364_238|We just do not do it.
p364_239|It was a long time coming.
p364_240|It had happened to him.
p364_241|That is our business.
p364_242|We were completely outplayed.
p364_243|The car driver was not injured.
p364_244|It was a surprising decision.
p364_245|Colin Cameron was excellent.
p364_246|I believe in having difficult times.
p364_247|Stand by for action.
p364_248|It was something special.
p364_249|He deserves a top team.
p364_250|We just need the Government to act.
p364_251|It was really surprising.
p364_252|It was a nightmare.
p364_253|But this is just the first step.
p364_254|We can do it.
p364_255|This is as bad as it gets.
p364_256|The real issue is personal.
p364_257|That can happen so easily.
p364_258|We deserved to get the victory today.
p364_259|That's the last thing he will do.
p364_260|FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
p364_261|It does not take much.
p364_262|It would be a bonus for this game.
p364_263|I've seen it work already.
p364_264|Do you mean today?
p364_265|Israeli forces denied the claim.
p364_266|This could be the case.
p364_267|We try to keep it right.
p364_268|I have got to keep the lid on.
p364_269|Or so we thought.
p364_270|For many, it had become a fact of life.
p364_271|Last season was very hard for me.
p364_272|It was a definite penalty.
p364_273|It's great fun to get to act.
p364_274|We are keen to have him back.
p364_275|Horses have some sense.
p364_276|It goes in cycles.
p364_277|And now he has decided, enough.
p364_278|Visiting fans were banned from attending the game.
p364_279|He made no comment.
p364_280|We have to get on with it.
p364_281|He was at the game, and he is indeed.
p364_282|It would be dangerous to resign.
p364_283|It is a victory to that extent.
p364_284|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
p364_285|I certainly hope so.
p364_286|She died later on Monday.
p374_001|Please call Stella.
p374_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p374_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p374_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p374_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p374_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p374_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p374_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p374_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p374_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p374_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p374_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p374_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p374_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p374_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p374_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p374_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p374_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p374_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p374_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p374_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p374_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p374_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p374_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p374_025|She had to learn a new discipline.
p374_026|This isn't some form of commission.
p374_027|The game today is certainly different.
p374_028|We did it in one take.
p374_029|I'll take the blame for that.
p374_030|And that was just for starters.
p374_031|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
p374_032|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p374_033|I will always remember the horrible images.
p374_034|What you sow, you have to reap.
p374_035|We are expecting a big crowd.
p374_036|I was contacted this morning.
p374_037|He didn't want me to leave the house.
p374_038|It's not just a challenge for us.
p374_039|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
p374_040|I've had a ball.
p374_041|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p374_042|YOU thought it was a headache.
p374_043|I still hope to go.
p374_044|Does that put pressure on us?
p374_045|As a player you have to move on.
p374_046|It is so out of character.
p374_047|I am inclined to play it down.
p374_048|However, it's good to turn the page.
p374_049|His condition was serious but stable.
p374_050|He had reason to be pleased.
p374_051|We have a problem.
p374_052|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p374_053|That alibi is now gone.
p374_054|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p374_055|I suspect the latter.
p374_056|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
p374_057|It is simple, really.
p374_058|The net is closing.
p374_059|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p374_060|That took a long time to happen.
p374_061|It was on fire.
p374_062|This year the exercise is being repeated.
p374_063|Nobody did in those days.
p374_064|You, the British people, are the boss.
p374_065|Where is the discipline?
p374_066|We were very much a happy family.
p374_067|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p374_068|This time it is official.
p374_069|It's going to be epic.
p374_070|She could easily have been killed.
p374_071|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p374_072|I didn't mean to kill her.
p374_073|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p374_074|That money could have been coming to Scotland.
p374_075|I'd love to do another Olympics.
p374_076|What method of funding is being used?
p374_077|It is not a standing army.
p374_078|This is a great day.
p374_079|He got his degree.
p374_080|I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
p374_081|and their remit is limited.
p374_082|I have great respect for all my players.
p374_083|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p374_084|There is no question of dithering.
p374_085|His track record is not promising.
p374_086|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p374_087|It would be very dangerous.
p374_088|Now it has been eclipsed.
p374_089|Our numbers are small.
p374_090|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p374_091|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p374_092|It's not right of Labour.
p374_093|It doesn't always work that way.
p374_094|This was much worse.
p374_095|That, though, is not true.
p374_096|I'm working at the moment.
p374_097|However, this is only the start.
p374_098|They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
p374_099|He loved it, and so did they.
p374_100|I want to be there by right.
p374_101|That was very important.
p374_102|Two and a half million people have died.
p374_103|I hope they understand that.
p374_104|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p374_105|It's a very, very special day.
p374_106|Let that be their memorial.
p374_107|We're all paying for it.
p374_108|Lester was like that.
p374_109|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p374_110|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
p374_111|We were never told it was already decided.
p374_112|It was a sickening sight.
p374_113|We are at an advanced stage, and are now instructing counsel.
p374_114|I don't think it would make any difference.
p374_115|They have just got to believe in themselves.
p374_116|If that is not a warning, what is it?
p374_117|I fell in love with it.
p374_118|It ignores the future.
p374_119|The quality of work is very impressive.
p374_120|That's not going to happen again.
p374_121|Paterson was the man.
p374_122|The course is in great condition.
p374_123|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p374_124|It is too early to speculate.
p374_125|It's up to them.
p374_126|They went to the press.
p374_127|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
p374_128|We are very pleased.
p374_129|You're not going to get hurt.
p374_130|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p374_131|I was very fortunate.
p374_132|It had been in place since last July.
p374_133|Players want to know what is on offer.
p374_134|They are a good team.
p374_135|The contest was already over.
p374_136|Does it make a profit?
p374_137|Now, that would impress the kids.
p374_138|It was the only possible decision.
p374_139|How much of a cop out is that?
p374_140|The whole region is in shock.
p374_141|Where is the logic in that?
p374_142|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p374_143|I told the players that at half-time.
p374_144|I see the extended family once a year.
p374_145|Why is this?
p374_146|It was indeed a night to remember.
p374_147|Raymond was always on the outside.
p374_148|There is something in this.
p374_149|And so it should.
p374_150|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p374_151|They may differ on other issues.
p374_152|That's the important thing.
p374_153|But opinion was divided.
p374_154|Next league matches Motherwell.
p374_155|I have been there already.
p374_156|My wife is totally behind me on this.
p374_157|Scott and Emily were so happy.
p374_158|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p374_159|But every two minutes it was exploding.
p374_160|And sooner than we may think.
p374_161|It is a step up.
p374_162|You probably have never seen them before.
p374_163|However, it is not all bad news for women.
p374_164|We're very proud of him and his achievement.
p374_165|Something has got to change.
p374_166|I made a mistake.
p374_167|I'd never given up on myself.
p374_168|That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
p374_169|That's the kind of production it was.
p374_170|Little girls are his victims.
p374_171|It is not for me, though.
p374_172|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p374_173|The rest is his own.
p374_174|The statement was a lie.
p374_175|It is the manager's decision.
p374_176|It was a day for records.
p374_177|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p374_178|There's no reason for panic.
p374_179|We have got away with it.
p374_180|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p374_181|I was doing well at the hustings.
p374_182|He had planned to sell it.
p374_183|It was just one of those days.
p374_184|But it did not last.
p374_185|She has been unable to work since.
p374_186|No-one has ever seen inside.
p374_187|I know nothing about that.
p374_188|We have not given up.
p374_189|Archer is no newcomer to the stage.
p374_190|It's a matter of time.
p374_191|The number never came.
p374_192|You encourage them - you can do it.
p374_193|The winner will be announced by early summer.
p374_194|This is the New Edinburgh.
p374_195|The stadium was full.
p374_196|There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
p374_197|Perhaps it is jealousy.
p374_198|His name is Michael Owen.
p374_199|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p374_200|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p374_201|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p374_202|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p374_203|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p374_204|It was so unfair.
p374_205|Smith has not let him down.
p374_206|They have to be dealt with.
p374_207|Glasgow is a friendly city.
p374_208|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p374_209|They were that poor.
p374_210|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p374_211|Stan is a vital part of our future.
p374_212|We're very close to being a good team.
p374_213|All these things have an impact.
p374_214|I thought their commitment was superb.
p374_215|I'm really proud of my young players.
p374_216|There was great support all round the route.
p374_217|I had nothing to lose.
p374_218|That is just not true.
p374_219|History is made at the Masters.
p374_220|This is not a European Army.
p374_221|Not so, he insisted.
p374_222|All of the names are familiar to me.
p374_223|I wonder what they listen to?
p374_224|Does a lot of drawing.
p374_225|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p374_226|There are moments of honesty, too.
p374_227|He is doing just that.
p374_228|The night is young.
p374_229|That is bad enough.
p374_230|We used to keep our business rates.
p374_231|I suspect that it will.
p374_232|We need to think.
p374_233|We are very happy with the verdict.
p374_234|They want it to work.
p374_235|For once it wasn't about money.
p374_236|It's not the end of the matter, of course.
p374_237|That doesn't happen in Europe.
p374_238|Jackson may well be right.
p374_239|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p374_240|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
p374_241|It's always somebody else's.
p374_242|It could now be up to the courts.
p374_243|We can make a difference.
p374_244|This was not a contest.
p374_245|It is just so sad.
p374_246|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
p374_247|This was not an easy meeting for me.
p374_248|It all depends on the Chancellor.
p374_249|I get very excited by that.
p374_250|The members have clearly spoken.
p374_251|It was not pretty.
p374_252|It was like a scene from the Holocaust.
p374_253|Which means it matters.
p374_254|This is certainly not the case.
p374_255|There is great potential on this river.
p374_256|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p374_257|Our thoughts are with his family.
p374_258|It is a technique.
p374_259|The court has not decided.
p374_260|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p374_261|I just want to get rid of it.
p374_262|I have not come in to take over.
p374_263|Is this accurate?
p374_264|But what did it matter?
p374_265|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p374_266|I am expecting to win.
p374_267|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p374_268|I was an athlete.
p374_269|We don't need to change the law.
p374_270|All of us do.
p374_271|Three months or so later, they are returning.
p374_272|That is partly true, but there are ways of doing it.
p374_273|We can only do that for so long.
p374_274|He got very close tonight.
p374_275|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p374_276|It is our other home.
p374_277|Where do you start?
p374_278|At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
p374_279|It was the first time they met.
p374_280|I am also delighted for all the players.
p374_281|We are delighted with that.
p374_282|He did very well, but didn't win.
p374_283|And we're not there yet.
p374_284|People don't feel safe, including me.
p374_285|Later we discovered it was a hoax.
p374_286|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p374_287|It is something that we will put right.
p374_288|I had a good life at Rangers.
p374_289|Perhaps we should do the same.
p374_290|He's very good at relating to adults.
p374_291|It opened last month.
p374_292|Just a year later he was dead.
p374_293|You must be ready to play anyone.
p374_294|This is a club on the rise.
p374_295|I had a sense of deja vu.
p374_296|That was the theory, anyway.
p374_297|I don't know them or anything.
p374_298|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p374_299|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p374_300|Because we do not need it.
p374_301|The atmosphere is businesslike.
p374_302|They use them for everything.
p374_303|I've already got this.
p374_304|There's a story, too.
p374_305|There have been different reports from different people.
p374_306|But it has all been worthwhile.
p374_307|But that's another story for another day.
p374_308|It was a foolhardy decision.
p374_309|This is as bad as it can get.
p374_310|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p374_311|It was just awful.
p374_312|There was a hell of a row.
p374_313|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p374_314|I am not a threat to coaches.
p374_315|It's never over until it's over.
p374_316|He had been a singer.
p374_317|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p374_318|If you're going to do it, do it right.
p374_319|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p374_320|No one was listening.
p374_321|It's not one for the purists.
p374_322|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p374_323|It really is good to be back.
p374_324|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p374_325|It will never happen.
p374_326|We cannot go on like this.
p374_327|The biggest thing is structure.
p374_328|This could be a recipe for conflict.
p374_329|This is great news for us.
p374_330|We certainly have to try something.
p374_331|SO now we know the secret.
p374_332|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p374_333|What is that?
p374_334|We just want them home.
p374_335|And we have beaten them before.
p374_336|He has two children.
p374_337|That is the fact of the matter.
p374_338|It was a matter of choice.
p374_339|And that's good news for the magpies.
p374_340|But we can't have a casino.
p374_341|I'm looking forward to that.
p374_342|So what is their secret?
p374_343|It's a great idea.
p374_344|It was not being marketed properly.
p374_345|I have been struggling with my form.
p374_346|That was about it.
p374_347|It is coming on very well.
p374_348|We won't go down without a struggle.
p374_349|By hard work, is the answer.
p374_350|We were unlucky not to score.
p374_351|I did not have a bet on myself.
p374_352|As if they ever stopped.
p374_353|And that brings us to the point.
p374_354|Clark is back on top form.
p374_355|But happily, the story is true.
p374_356|It does seem a mystery.
p374_357|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p374_358|It's for that reason he should resign.
p374_359|It's a good start.
p374_360|One person had a broken back.
p374_361|I hope that is the lucky break.
p374_362|It is almost like a family.
p374_363|But when we do it is great.
p374_364|I disagree entirely with the decision.
p374_365|My game is coming back.
p374_366|It was a game they could have won.
p374_367|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p374_368|It is a matter for Westminster.
p374_369|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p374_370|I can't believe the buzz.
p374_371|Sport is good for you.
p374_372|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p374_373|This is not a struggle against Islam.
p374_374|This is the goal.
p374_375|The mood was euphoric.
p374_376|I want to get at the truth.
p374_377|Everyone here is very sad.
p374_378|It was located on the remote control.
p374_379|I am not changing my mind.
p374_380|Is something which we just don't do.
p374_381|He was taken ill in his office.
p374_382|It is, though the law is not clear cut.
p374_383|It's the only thing.
p374_384|Two others were also seriously injured.
p374_385|What's the best thing to do?
p374_386|For tragedy it is.
p374_387|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p374_388|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p374_389|It was good today.
p374_390|We are all very pleased.
p374_391|The hotel was huge.
p374_392|These days are over.
p374_393|They do it properly.
p374_394|Well, you can have a tree.
p374_395|I just don't know what she was doing.
p374_396|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p374_397|You can't have both.
p374_398|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p374_399|I was influenced by all of these things.
p374_400|You do not change overnight.
p374_401|Or so it seemed.
p374_402|I will have to think about it.
p374_403|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p374_404|Well, you can't have everything.
p376_001|"Please call Stella.  "
p376_002|"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  "
p376_003|"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  "
p376_004|"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  "
p376_005|"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. "
p376_006|"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. "
p376_007|"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. "
p376_008|"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. "
p376_009|"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. "
p376_010|"People look, but no one ever finds it. "
p376_011|"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. "
p376_012|"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. "
p376_013|"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. "
p376_014|"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. "
p376_015|"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. "
p376_016|"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. "
p376_017|"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. "
p376_018|"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. "
p376_019|"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. "
p376_020|"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. "
p376_021|"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. "
p376_022|"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. "
p376_023|"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. "
p376_024|"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p376_025|"It's a relief that a decision has finally been made."
p376_026|"But it failed."
p376_027|"He said the matter had been neglected in the past."
p376_028|"We have to pull together, or we will hang apart."
p376_029|"Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format."
p376_030|"Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed."
p376_031|"So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic."
p376_032|"We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent."
p376_033|"Because we do not need it."
p376_034|"It's a matter of balance."
p376_035|"And we have a singer."
p376_036|"Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist."
p376_037|"He has not been named."
p376_038|"It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies."
p376_039|"They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life."
p376_040|"It was clear."
p376_041|"It is urgent."
p376_042|"A neighbour said."
p376_043|"We need to chat."
p376_044|"We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there."
p376_045|"It's the same old story."
p376_046|"That should do it."
p376_048|"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids."
p376_049|"A recording contract is on the horizon."
p376_050|"It has been a horrible, horrible time."
p376_051|"He looks like an Afghan."
p376_052|"They had to explain it."
p376_053|"However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress."
p376_054|"But the law is very clear on this."
p376_055|"We were surprised to see the photograph."
p376_056|"Next league matches Celtic."
p376_057|"Sadly, it can't."
p376_058|"This is a step backwards."
p376_059|"It will take time."
p376_060|"The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine."
p376_061|"Four other charges were dropped."
p376_063|"Art is extra."
p376_064|"George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision."
p376_065|"An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year."
p376_066|"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music."
p376_067|"We should have known."
p376_068|"It should be devolved."
p376_069|"Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise."
p376_070|"We welcome the decision of Mr Byers."
p376_071|"They do not work for Glasgow City Council."
p376_072|"The price cuts are really exciting."
p376_073|"Neither it is."
p376_074|"She died in hospital two hours later."
p376_075|"It is a job creation scheme."
p376_076|"Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general."
p376_077|"This is the way things should be handled."
p376_078|"It is not long term, but I need time to recover."
p376_079|"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night."
p376_080|"Nothing is yet confirmed."
p376_081|"No progress has been made."
p376_082|"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats."
p376_083|"They lived for their children."
p376_084|"That will come after the game on Saturday."
p376_085|"Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today."
p376_086|"This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit."
p376_087|"She told The Herald."
p376_088|"Then came the crunch."
p376_089|"The oil companies would be asked to contribute."
p376_090|"I love the Dome."
p376_091|"We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football."
p376_092|"They are now divorced."
p376_093|"Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom."
p376_094|"The selection process is still at a very early stage."
p376_095|"Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights."
p376_096|"It was mayhem."
p376_097|"But it was a pleasure."
p376_098|"We live by the rule of law."
p376_099|"Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill."
p376_100|"We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors."
p376_101|"Oil embargo endorsed."
p376_102|"He takes the job."
p376_103|"According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland."
p376_104|"It's not a new concept in jazz."
p376_105|"I'm so angry."
p376_106|"The fire was above the hole."
p376_107|"We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail."
p376_108|"Maybe this battle has been."
p376_109|"But the fans deserve to know!"
p376_110|"It is rubbish."
p376_111|"Who would be a referee?"
p376_112|"This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election."
p376_113|"There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end."
p376_114|"It is a delight on every level."
p376_115|"Here, again, they were denied a voice."
p376_116|"She has been shot."
p376_117|"It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged."
p376_118|"Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton."
p376_119|"I was furious."
p376_120|"She really suffered for her art."
p376_121|"So the European elections are extremely important."
p376_122|"Death is outside the language."
p376_123|"Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince."
p376_124|"Some of the characters will not be played by humans."
p376_125|"Well, you can have a tree."
p376_126|"Twaddle is a case in point."
p376_127|"It will be too hot."
p376_128|"It's the big omission."
p376_129|"If not, a deal could take many months."
p376_130|"We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider."
p376_131|"The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend."
p376_132|"It's not true."
p376_133|"Police could not say if the two incidents were connected."
p376_134|"It was typical."
p376_135|"It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday."
p376_136|"Nobody in the world can get away from him."
p376_137|"He sees a difference in the style of the two teams."
p376_138|"We've got a lot of respect for the Lions."
p376_139|"I think he's the favourite, no question."
p376_140|"The boy is no longer with us."
p376_141|"There is a lack of chemistry."
p376_142|"Is that Titanic?"
p376_143|"I was awful."
p376_144|"The idea is simple."
p376_145|"It is like a football team."
p376_146|"It is not just about pay."
p376_147|"He will emerge as a world leader."
p376_148|"They did very well."
p376_149|"The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday."
p376_150|"The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough."
p376_151|"The weaknesses are few."
p376_152|"The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight."
p376_153|"It was deployed in the Gulf War."
p376_154|"Mr Blair had done well."
p376_155|"We also enjoyed a lot of support."
p376_156|"I was in daily contact."
p376_157|"Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday."
p376_158|"My Dad is a hero."
p376_159|"The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers."
p376_160|"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance."
p376_161|"There's a pause."
p376_162|"It was so new, so exciting."
p376_163|"He's been the key to everything."
p376_164|"Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks."
p376_165|"Military action is the only option we have on the table today."
p376_166|"I was in the train station overnight."
p376_167|"By then, however, both men were already in the US."
p376_168|"They will do their own thing."
p376_169|"You had to go and see him."
p376_170|"The release attracted little attention."
p376_171|"Waiting times for these services are too long."
p376_172|"A helpline number is published at the end of this article."
p376_173|"First and foremost, the game is entirely different."
p376_174|"This is a sad day."
p376_175|"There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging."
p376_176|"We are very concerned about controller fatigue."
p376_177|"It is the whole package."
p376_178|"It's an idea."
p376_179|"Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted."
p376_180|"I have no sympathy with her at all."
p376_181|"Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe."
p376_182|"Miller was every bit as happy."
p376_183|"I saw military vehicles in the distance."
p376_184|"The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday."
p376_185|"What has caused the demise of singing?"
p376_186|"I had a train to catch."
p376_187|"It is a terrible loss."
p376_188|"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed."
p376_189|"I would love it."
p376_190|"Last night was a key episode."
p376_191|"I am totally surprised."
p376_192|"I came home by ambulance."
p376_193|"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address."
p376_194|"We've had an enjoyable adventure."
p376_195|"The group is separate from the Real IRA."
p376_196|"Is that success?"
p376_197|"The service from the other players was super."
p376_198|"But we are not immune to the problem."
p376_199|"The sisters also became the top two players in the world."
p376_200|"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring."
p376_201|"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling."
p376_202|"It was worth a photograph."
p376_203|"I don't want to use it."
p376_204|"HARRY Potter has lost his magic."
p376_205|"That is an important part of our role."
p376_206|"I had relied on him."
p376_207|"I began to pray."
p376_208|"I am delighted for Simon."
p376_209|"He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland."
p376_210|"The FBI could become involved."
p376_211|"A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar."
p376_212|"His death was a tragic accident."
p376_213|"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football."
p376_214|"I am really going to miss him."
p376_215|"That has been the easy part."
p376_216|"We could be here for a number of weeks."
p376_217|"Clearly, the stakes are high."
p376_218|"It's a question of creating a future awareness."
p376_219|"It is a gamble."
p376_220|"At the time, he was a living legend."
p376_221|"My wife and family are the support system."
p376_222|"Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable."
p376_223|"Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party."
p376_224|"We're looking for justice."
p376_225|"However, no further action was taken by police."
p376_226|"They had no children."
p376_227|"And thought we would get away with it."
p376_228|"Half of young people had had contact with the police."
p376_229|"Well, they were the unlucky ones."
p376_230|"It's very safe."
p376_231|"Sadly, it sounds as if it is."
p376_232|"Hospitals are for the ill."
p376_233|"It would still have been a good film, but very different."
p376_234|"We have a free vote on these things in our party."
p376_235|"We lost our composure towards the interval, he said."
p376_236|"It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet."
p376_237|"You can feel at home in China."
p376_238|"In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify."
p376_239|"The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery."
p376_240|"It is a policy which has the full support of the minister."
p376_241|"We will need to study the report before any decision is taken."
p376_242|"I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country."
p376_243|"I can't get a job."
p376_244|"He said he intended to push for a judicial review."
p376_245|"We have got no money to go anywhere."
p376_246|"I watched a game."
p376_247|"Chelsea was a great club."
p376_248|"The car was just there."
p376_249|"I am very angry."
p376_250|"The pensioners did not want to know."
p376_251|"It is also very valuable."
p376_252|"This court has made an order which has not been observed."
p376_253|"That is highly unfair."
p376_254|"It's all change on the music scene in Manchester."
